		"abstract": "This paper presents a description of the CESM/DART ensemble coupled data assimilation (DA) system based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) assimilation software. The CESM/DART should be viewed as a flexible system to support the DA needs of the CESM research community and not as a static reanalysis product. In this implementation of the CESM/DART, conventional insitu observations of the ocean and atmosphere are assimilated into the respective component models of the CESM using a 30-member ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). CESM/DART is run in a “weakly coupled” configuration wherein observations native to each climate system component only directly impact the state vector for that component. Information is passed between components indirectly through the short-term coupled model forecasts that provide the EAKF background ensemble. This system leverages previous ensemble DA development for the Community Atmosphere Model and Parallel Ocean Program models using the DART EAKF. The CESM/DART project is a step towards providing increasingly useful DA capabilities for the CESM research community. Results are presented for our prototype 12-year reanalysis, run from 1970 to mid 1982. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the system is capable of constraining the CESM coupled model to simulate the historical variability of the climate system in the well-observed Northern Hemisphere. A collection of monthly average variables, climate mode indices, observation diagnostics and snapshots of synoptic weather in the ocean and atmosphere are compared to established datasets, showing especially good agreement in the Northern Hemisphere. A discussion of the CESM/DART as a modular, community facility and the benefits and challenges associated with this vision is also included.",

MPEX was motivated by the basic question of whether experimental, subsynoptic observations can extend convective-scale predictability and otherwise enhance skill in short-term regional numerical weather prediction.</p><p>Observational tools for MPEX included the National Science Foundation (NSF)–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Gulfstream V aircraft (GV), which featured the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System mini-dropsonde system and a microwave temperature-profiling (MTP) system as well as several ground-based mobile upsonde systems. Basic operations involved two missions per day: an early morning mission with the GV, well upstream of anticipated convective storms, and an afternoon and early evening mission with the mobile sounding units to sample the initiation and upscale feedbacks of the convection.</p><p>A total of 18 intensive observing periods (IOPs) were completed during the field phase, representing a wide spectrum of synoptic regimes and convective events, including several major severe weather and/or tornado outbreak days. The novel observational strategy employed during MPEX is documented herein, as is the unique role of the ensemble modeling efforts—which included an ensemble sensitivity analysis—to both guide the observational strategies and help address the potential impacts of such enhanced observations on short-term convective forecasting. Preliminary results of retrospective data assimilation experiments are discussed, as are data analyses showing upscale convective feedbacks.</p></section>",

The forecasts were generated by smoothing the locations where model output indicated extreme values of updraft helicity, a surrogate for rotating thunderstorms in model output. The day 1 surrogate severe probability forecasts (SSPFs) produced skillful and reliable predictions of severe weather during this period, after an appropriate calibration of the smoothing kernel. The ensemble SSPFs exceeded the skill of SSPFs derived from two benchmark deterministic forecasts, with the largest differences occurring on the mesoscale, while all SSPFs produced similar forecasts on synoptic scales. While the deterministic SSPFs often overforecasted high probabilities, the ensemble improved the reliability of these probabilities, at the expense of producing fewer high-probability values. For the day 2 period, the SSPFs provided competitive guidance compared to the day 1 forecasts, although additional smoothing was needed to produce the same level of skill, reducing the forecast sharpness. Results were similar using 10 ensemble members, suggesting value exists when running a smaller ensemble if computational resources are limited. Finally, the SSPFs were compared to severe weather risk areas identified in Storm Prediction Center (SPC) convective outlooks. The SSPF skill was comparable to the SPC outlook skill in identifying regions where severe weather would occur, although performance varied on a day-to-day basis.</p></section>",

The diagnostics included midlevel (2–5 km AGL) updraft helicity (UH25), low-level (0–3 km AGL) updraft helicity (UH03), and low-level (1 km AGL) vertical relative vorticity (RVORT1). RVORT1 was used as a direct measure of low-level rotation strength. Each storm’s RVORT1 magnitude and near-storm environment properties were extracted from each hour’s forecasts using an object-based approach. The near-storm environments of storm objects with large magnitudes of RVORT1 were very similar to the environments identified as conducive for the development of tornadic supercells in previous proximity sounding-based studies (e.g., low lifted condensation levels and strong low-level shear). This motivated the use of RVORT1 as a direct surrogate for tornadoes, without the need to filter forecasts with environmental information. The relationship between UH25 and UH03 was also explored among the simulated storms; UH03 only exceeded UH25 in storms occurring within low-CAPE/high-shear environments, while UH03 rarely exceeded UH25 in traditional supercell environments. Next-day ensemble surrogate severe probability forecasts (E-SSPFs) for tornadoes were generated using these diagnostics for 92 forecasts, with thresholds based on the number of observed tornado reports. E-SSPFs for tornadoes using RVORT1 and UH03 were more skillful than E-SSPFs using UH25. The UH25 E-SSPFs possessed little skill, regardless of threshold or smoothing length scale. All E-SSPFs suffered from poor sharpness at skillful scales, with few forecast probabilities greater than 40%.</p></section>",

These neighborhood approaches relax the requirement that perfect forecasts must match observations at the grid scale, contrasting traditional point-by-point verification methods. One recently proposed metric, the neighborhood equitable threat score, is calculated from 2 × 2 contingency tables that are populated within a neighborhood framework. However, the literature suggests three subtly different methods of populating neighborhood-based contingency tables. Thus, this work compares and contrasts these three variants and shows they yield statistically significantly different conclusions regarding forecast performance, illustrating that neighborhood-based contingency tables should be constructed carefully and transparently. Furthermore, this paper shows how two of the methods use inconsistent event definitions and suggests a “neighborhood maximum” approach be used to fill neighborhood-based contingency tables.</p></section>",

However, 10-member, 1-km probabilistic forecasts usually were best, especially over the first 12 h and at rainfall rates ≥ 5.0 mm h<sup>−1</sup> at later times. Further object-based investigation revealed that better 1-km forecasts at heavier rainfall rates were associated with more accurate placement of mesoscale convective systems compared to 3-km forecasts. The collective results indicate promise for 1-km ensembles once computational resources can support their operational implementation.</p></section>",

Graphical forecast products were posted in real time to the Internet, where they attracted a large following from both forecasters and researchers across government, academia, and the private sector. Although these forecasts were initially planned to terminate after one year, the project was extended through 30 December 2017 because of the enthusiastic community response. This article details the motivation for the NCAR ensemble project and describes the project’s impacts throughout the meteorological community. Classroom and operational use of the NCAR ensemble are discussed in addition to the diverse application of NCAR ensemble output for research purposes. Furthermore, some performance statistics are provided, and the NCAR ensemble website and data visualization approach are described. We hope the NCAR ensemble’s success will motivate additional experimental forecast demonstrations that transcend current operational capabilities, as forward-looking forecast systems are needed to accelerate operational development and provide students, young scientists, and forecasters with glimpses of what future modeling systems may look like. Additionally, the NCAR ensemble dataset is publicly available and can be used for meaningful research endeavors concerning many meteorological topics.</p></section>",

		"abstract": "This study presents the development and application of gridded Bayesian linear regression (GBLR) as a new statistical postprocessing technique to improve deterministic numerical weather prediction of storm wind speed forecasts over the northeast United States. GBLR products are produced by interpolating regression coefficients deduced from modeled-observed pairs of historical storms at meteorological stations to grid points, thus producing a gridded product. The GBLR model is developed for the 10 members of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) real-time dynamic ensemble prediction system for a database composed of 92 storms, using leave-one-storm-out cross validation. GBLR almost eliminates the bias of the raw deterministic prediction and achieves average coefficient of determination (R2) improvement of 36% and root-mean-square error reduction of 29% with respect to the ensemble mean for individual storm forecasts. Moreover, verification using leave-one-station-out cross validation indicates that the GBLR model provides acceptable forecast improvements for grid points where no observations are available. The GBLR technique contributes to improving gridded storm wind speed forecasts using past event-based data and has the potential to be implemented in real time.",

The various CAEs solely differed by their initial condition perturbations (ICPs) and central initial states. CAEs initially centered about deterministic Global Forecast System (GFS) analyses were unequivocally better than those initially centered about ensemble mean analyses produced by a limited-area single-physics, single-dynamics 15-km continuously cycling ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), strongly suggesting relative superiority of the GFS analyses. Additionally, CAEs with flow-dependent ICPs derived from either the EnKF or multimodel 3-h forecasts from the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) system had higher fractions skill scores than CAEs with randomly generated mesoscale ICPs. Conversely, due to insufficient spread, CAEs with EnKF ICPs had worse reliability, discrimination, and dispersion than those with random and SREF ICPs. However, members in the CAE with SREF ICPs undesirably clustered by dynamic core represented in the ICPs, and CAEs with random ICPs had poor spinup characteristics. Collectively, these results indicate that continuously cycled EnKF mean analyses were suboptimal for CAE initialization purposes and suggest that further work to improve limited-area continuously cycling EnKFs over large regional domains is warranted. Additionally, the deleterious aspects of using both multimodel and random ICPs suggest efforts toward improving spread in CAEs with single-physics, single-dynamics, flow-dependent ICPs should continue.</p></section>",

This PM product was called the PM max and its localized version was called the local PM (LPM) max. Both products were generated from a 10-member ensemble with 3-km horizontal grid spacing and evaluated over 364 36-h forecasts in terms of the fractions skill score. Performances of the PM max and LPM max were compared to those of the traditional PM mean and LPM mean, which both used the ensemble mean (EnMean) as the basis for spatial reassignment. Compared to observations, the PM max typically outperformed the PM mean for precipitation rates ≥5 mm h<sup>−1</sup>; this improvement was related to the EnMax, which had better spatial placement than the EnMean for heavy precipitation. However, the PM mean produced better forecasts than the PM max for lighter precipitation. It appears that the global reassignment used to produce the PM max was responsible for its poorer performance relative to the PM mean at light precipitation rates, as the LPM max was more skillful than the LPM mean at all thresholds. These results suggest promise for PM products based on the EnMax, especially for rare events and ensembles with insufficient spread.</p></section>",

		"abstract": "An experiment is conducted to compare four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation systems and their predictability in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). The quality of the ocean-state estimates, forecasts, and the contribution of ensemble prediction are evaluated. The MITgcm–Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) 4DVAR (MITgcm–ECCO) and the MITgcm–Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) EnKF (MITgcm–DART) systems were used to compute two-month hindcasts (March–April, 2010) by assimilating satellite-derived along-track sea-surface height (SSH) and gridded sea-surface temperature (SST) observations. The estimates from both methods at the end of the hindcast period were then used to initialize forecasts for two months (May–June, 2010). This period was selected because a loop current (LC) eddy (Eddy Franklin: Eddy-F) detachment event occurred at the end of May 2010, immediately after the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill. Despite some differences between the setups, both systems produce analyses and forecasts of comparable quality and both solutions significantly outperformed model persistence. A reference forecast initialized from the 1/12° Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM)/NCODA global analysis also performed well. The EnKF experiments for sensitivity to filter parameters showed enhanced predictability when using more ensemble members and stronger covariance localization, but not for larger inflation. The EnKF experiments varying the number of assimilation cycles showed enhanced short-term (long-term) predictability with fewer (more) assimilation cycles. Additional hindcast and forecast experiments at other times of significant LC evolution showed mixed performance of both systems, which depends strongly on the background state of the GoM circulation. The present work demonstrates a practical application of both assimilation methods for the GoM and compares them in a limited number of realizations. The overall conclusion showing improved short-term (long-term) predictability for EnKF (4DVAR) carries an important caveat that the results from this study are specific to a few 4DVAR and EnKF LC eddy separation experiments in the GoM and cannot be generalized to conclude the relative performance of both methods, especially in other applications. However, some of the concepts and methods should carry over to other applications.",

		"abstract": "The performance of two common approaches to data assimilation, an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) and a 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method, is quantified in a popular community ocean model, the Regional Ocean Modeling Systems (ROMS). Two distinct circulation environments are considered: the California Current System (CCS), which is an eastern boundary upwelling regime, and the Indian Ocean (IO) characterized by an equatorial waveguide subject to the energetic seasonal reversals of the Indian and Asian Monsoons. In the case of the CCS, experiments were performed using synthetic observations, so-called Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). An extensive suite of CCS OSSEs were conducted to explore the performance of both data assimilation approaches to system configuration. For the EAKF, this includes the method for generating the seed ensemble, ensemble size, localization scales, and the length of the assimilation window. In the case of 4D-Var, the influence of assimilation window length, and the formulation of the background error covariance were explored. The performance of the EAKF was found to be influenced most by the size of the ensemble and by the method used to generate the initial seed ensemble where centering of the ensemble was found to yield improvement. For 4D-Var, the assimilation window length is by far the most critical factor, with an increase in system performance as the window length is extended. In general, the EAKF and 4D-Var systems converge to similar solutions over time, which are independent of the starting point. The EAKF employs a First-Guess at Appropriate Time (FGAT) strategy, and some experiments indicate that short FGAT windows can be problematic due to the introduction of frequent initialization shocks. While the EAKF generally out-performs 4D-Var in the OSSEs, analysis of the innovations from the two systems through time indicates that they track each other closely. Additional Observing System Experiments (OSEs) were performed in the CCS and IO configurations of ROMS using real ocean observations. In this case, the comparison of the EAKF and 4D-Var state estimates with independent observations indicates that the EAKF and 4D-Var state estimates diverge over time, although the 4D-Var estimates are somewhat better by some measures. The relative performance of the EAKF and 4D-Var systems is similar across the wide-range of circulation regimes that characterize the CCS and IO, suggesting that the results presented here are a robust indicator of expected performance in other regions of the world ocean.",

		"abstract": "Good performance with small ensemble filters applied to models with many state variables may require ‘localizing’ the impact of an observation to state variables that are ‘close’ to the observation. As a step in developing nearly generic ensemble filter assimilation systems, a method to estimate ‘localization’ functions is presented. Localization is viewed as a means to ameliorate sampling error when small ensembles are used to sample the statistical relation between an observation and a state variable. The impact of spurious sample correlations between an observation and model state variables is estimated using a ‘hierarchical ensemble filter’, where an ensemble of ensemble filters is used to detect sampling error. Hierarchical filters can adapt to a wide array of ensemble sizes and observational error characteristics with only limited heuristic tuning. Hierarchical filters can allow observations to efficiently impact state variables, even when the notion of ‘distance’ between the observation and the state variables cannot be easily defined. For instance, defining the distance between an observation of radar reflectivity from a particular radar and beam angle taken at 1133 GMT and a model temperature variable at 700 hPa 60 km north of the radar beam at 1200 GMT is challenging. The hierarchical filter estimates sampling error from a ‘group’ of ensembles and computes a factor between 0 and 1 to minimize sampling error. An a priori notion of distance is not required. Results are shown in both a low-order model and a simple atmospheric GCM. For low-order models, the hierarchical filter produces ‘localization’ functions that are very similar to those already described in the literature. When observations are more complex or taken at different times from the state specification (in ensemble smoothers for instance), the localization functions become increasingly distinct from those used previously. In the GCM, this complexity reaches a level that suggests that it would be difficult to define efficient localization functions a priori. There is a cost trade-off between running hierarchical filters or running a traditional filter with larger ensemble size. Hierarchical filters can be run for short training periods to develop localization statistics that can be used in a traditional ensemble filter to produce high quality assimilations at reasonable cost, even when the relation between observations and state variables is not well-known a priori. Additional research is needed to determine if it is ever cost-efficient to run hierarchical filters for large data assimilation problems instead of traditional filters with the corresponding total number of ensemble members.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the development of an advanced ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based ocean data assimilation system for prediction of the evolution of the loop current in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The system integrates the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) assimilation package with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). The MITgcm/DART system supports the assimilation of a wide range of ocean observations and uses an ensemble approach to solve the nonlinear assimilation problems. The GoM prediction system was implemented with an eddy-resolving 1/10th degree configuration of the MITgcm. Assimilation experiments were performed over a 6-month period between May and October during a strong loop current event in 1999. The model was sequentially constrained with weekly satellite sea surface temperature and altimetry data. Experiments results suggest that the ensemble-based assimilation system shows a high predictive skill in the GoM, with estimated ensemble spread mainly concentrated around the front of the loop current. Further analysis of the system estimates demonstrates that the ensemble assimilation accurately reproduces the observed features without imposing any negative impact on the dynamical balance of the system. Results from sensitivity experiments with respect to the ensemble filter parameters are also presented and discussed.",

		"abstract": "A theory for estimating the probability distribution of the state of a model given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory unifies the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem that have been key foci of prediction and predictability research for numerical weather and ocean prediction applications. A new algorithm, referred to as an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and the more traditional implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter in which “perturbed observations” are used, are derived as Monte Carlo approximations to the nonlinear filter. Both ensemble Kalman filter methods produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while providing reasonable measures of uncertainty in the assimilated variables. The ensemble methods can assimilate observations with a nonlinear relation to model state variables and can also use observations to estimate the value of imprecisely known model parameters. These ensemble filter methods are shown to have significant advantages over four-dimensional variational assimilation in low-order models and scale easily to much larger applications. Heuristic modifications to the filtering algorithms allow them to be applied efficiently to very large models by sequentially processing observations and computing the impact of each observation on each state variable in an independent calculation. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is applied to a nondivergent barotropic model on the sphere to demonstrate the capabilities of the filters in models with state spaces that are much larger than the ensemble size. When observations are assimilated in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, the resulting updated ensemble has a mean that is consistent with the value given by filtering theory, but only the expected value of the covariance of the updated ensemble is consistent with the theory. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter computes a linear operator that is applied to the prior ensemble estimate of the state, resulting in an updated ensemble whose mean and also covariance are consistent with the theory. In the cases compared here, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter performs significantly better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, apparently because noise introduced into the assimilated ensemble through perturbed observations in the traditional filter limits its relative performance. This superior performance may not occur for all problems and is expected to be most notable for small ensembles. Still, the results suggest that careful study of the capabilities of different varieties of ensemble Kalman filters is appropriate when exploring new applications.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Sampling errors and model errors are major drawbacks from which ensemble Kalman filters suffer. Sampling errors arise because of the use of a limited ensemble size, while model errors are deficiencies in the dynamics and underlying parameterizations that may yield biases in the model’s prediction. In this study, we propose a new time-adaptive posterior inflation algorithm in which the analyzed ensemble anomalies are locally inflated. The proposed inflation strategy is computationally efficient and is aimed at restoring enough spread in the analysis ensemble after assimilating the observations. The performance of this scheme is tested against the relaxation to prior spread (RTPS) and adaptive prior inflation. For this purpose, two model are used: the three-variable Lorenz 63 system and the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). In CAM, global refractivity, temperature, and wind observations from several sources are incorporated to perform a set of assimilation experiments using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The proposed scheme is shown to yield better quality forecasts than the RTPS. Assimilation results further suggest that when model errors are small, both prior and posterior inflation are able to mitigate sampling errors with a slight advantage to posterior inflation. When large model errors, such as wind and temperature biases, are present, prior inflation is shown to be more accurate than posterior inflation. Densely observed regions as in the Northern Hemisphere present numerous challenges to the posterior inflation algorithm. A compelling enhancement to the performance of the filter is achieved by combining both adaptive inflation schemes.",

Currently, the operational utilization of advanced data assimilation methods in the oceanic initialization is still relatively less and its benefit is far from being fully unveiled. In this study, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) is configured with an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) to initialize the seasonal prediction. The performance of the established prediction system is assessed by comparing it with a benchmark prediction system, which is based on the same model but with a nudging scheme. Results show that the assimilation of only oceanic observations can not only effectively constrain the oceanic variables, but also improves the atmospheric variables through coupling processes, which helps to produce accurate and compatible initial conditions. With the initial conditions, the current prediction system is better than the benchmark prediction system and can produce skillful predictions for sea surface temperature, ocean heat content, air temperature at 2 m, precipitation and major climate variabilities including El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The current prediction system also shows better ensemble consistency and less prediction drifts, which could contribute to the improvement of prediction skill.",

The adaptive Bayesian scheme of Anderson uses available observations to update the Gaussian inflation distribution assigned for every state variable. The likelihood function of the inflation is computed using model-minus-data innovation statistics. A number of enhancements for this inflation scheme are proposed. To prevent excessive deflation, an inverse gamma distribution for the prior inflation is considered. A non-Gaussian distribution offers a flexible framework for the inflation variance to evolve during the update. The innovations are assumed random variables, and a correction term is added to the mode of the likelihood distribution such that the observed inflation is slightly larger. This modification improves the stability of the adaptive scheme by limiting the occurrence of negative and physically intolerable inflations. The enhanced scheme is compared to the original one in twin experiments using the Lorenz-63 model, the Lorenz-96 model, and an idealized, high-dimensional atmospheric model. Results show that the proposed enhancements are capable of generating accurate and consistent state estimates. Allowing moderate deflation is shown to be useful.",

		"abstract": "The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is an open-source community facility for data assimilation education, research, and development. DART's ensemble data assimilation algorithms, careful software engineering, and diagnostic tools allow atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, hydrologists, chemists, and other geophysicists to build state-of-the-art data assimilation systems with unprecedented ease. For global numerical weather prediction, DART produces ensemble-mean analyses comparable to analyses from major centers while also providing initial conditions for ensemble predictions. In addition, DART supports more novel assimilation applications like parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, observing system design, and smoothing. Implementing basic systems for large models requires only a few person-weeks; comprehensive systems have been built in a few months. Incorporating new observation types is also straightforward, requiring only a forward operator mapping between a model's state and an observation's expected value. Forward operators for standard, in situ observations and novel types, like GPS radio occultation soundings, are available. DART algorithms scale well on a variety of parallel architectures, allowing large data assimilation problems to be studied. DART also includes many low-order models and an ensemble assimilation tutorial appropriate for undergraduate and graduate instruction.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A variant of a least squares ensemble (Kalman) filter that is suitable for implementation on parallel architectures is presented. This parallel ensemble filter produces results that are identical to those from sequential algorithms already described in the literature when forward observation operators that relate the model state vector to the expected value of observations are linear (although actual results may differ due to floating point arithmetic round-off error). For nonlinear forward observation operators, the sequential and parallel algorithms solve different linear approximations to the full problem but produce qualitatively similar results. The parallel algorithm can be implemented to produce identical answers with the state variable prior ensembles arbitrarily partitioned onto a set of processors for the assimilation step (no caveat on round-off is needed for this result). Example implementations of the parallel algorithm are described for environments with low (high) communication latency and cost. Hybrids of these implementations and the traditional sequential ensemble filter can be designed to optimize performance for a variety of parallel computing environments. For large models on machines with good communications, it is possible to implement the parallel algorithm to scale efficiently to thousands of processors while bit-wise reproducing the results from a single processor implementation. Timing results on several Linux clusters are presented from an implementation appropriate for machines with low-latency communication. Most ensemble Kalman filter variants that have appeared in the literature differ only in the details of how a prior ensemble estimate of a scalar observation is updated given an observed value and the observational error distribution. These details do not impact other parts of either the sequential or parallel filter algorithms here, so a variety of ensemble filters including ensemble square root and perturbed observations filters can be used with all the implementations described.",

		"abstract": "Predicting major floods during extreme rainfall events remains an important challenge. Rapid changes in flows over short timescales, combined with multiple sources of model error, makes it difficult to accurately simulate intense floods. This study presents a general data assimilation framework that aims to improve flood predictions in channel routing models. Hurricane Florence, which caused catastrophic flooding and damages in the Carolinas in September 2018, is used as a case study. The National Water Model (NWM) configuration of the WRF-Hydro modeling framework is interfaced with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) to produce ensemble streamflow forecasts and analyses. Instantaneous streamflow observations from 107 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauges are assimilated for a period of 1 month.\n\n The data assimilation (DA) system developed in this paper explores two novel contributions, namely (1) along-the-stream (ATS) covariance localization and (2) spatially and temporally varying adaptive covariance inflation. ATS localization aims to mitigate not only spurious correlations, due to limited ensemble size, but also physically incorrect correlations between unconnected and indirectly connected state variables in the river network. We demonstrate that ATS localization provides improved information propagation during the model update. Adaptive prior inflation is used to tackle errors in the prior, including large model biases which often occur in flooding situations. Analysis errors incurred during the update are addressed using posterior inflation. Results show that ATS localization is a crucial ingredient of our hydrologic DA system, providing at least 40 % more accurate (root mean square error) streamflow estimates than regular, Euclidean distance-based localization. An assessment of hydrographs indicates that adaptive inflation is extremely useful and perhaps indispensable for improving the forecast skill during flooding events with significant model errors. We argue that adaptive prior inflation is able to serve as a vigorous bias correction scheme which varies both spatially and temporally. Major improvements over the model's severely underestimated streamflow estimates are suggested along the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, and many other locations in the domain, where inflation is able to avoid filter divergence and, thereby, assimilate significantly more observations.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Particle filters avoid parametric estimates for Bayesian posterior densities, which alleviates Gaussian assumptions in nonlinear regimes. These methods, however, are more sensitive to sampling errors than Gaussian-based techniques such as ensemble Kalman filters. A recent study by the authors introduced an iterative strategy for particle filters that match posterior moments—where iterations improve the filter’s ability to draw samples from non-Gaussian posterior densities. The iterations follow from a factorization of particle weights, providing a natural framework for combining particle filters with alternative filters to mitigate the impact of sampling errors. The current study introduces a novel approach to forming an adaptive hybrid data assimilation methodology, exploiting the theoretical strengths of nonparametric and parametric filters. At each data assimilation cycle, the iterative particle filter performs a sequence of updates while the prior sample distribution is non-Gaussian, then an ensemble Kalman filter provides the final adjustment when Gaussian distributions for marginal quantities are detected. The method employs the Shapiro–Wilk test to determine when to make the transition between filter algorithms, which has outstanding power for detecting departures from normality. Experiments using low-dimensional models demonstrate that the approach has a significant value, especially for nonhomogeneous observation networks and unknown model process errors. Moreover, hybrid factors are extended to consider marginals of more than one collocated variables using a test for multivariate normality. Findings from this study motivate the use of the proposed method for geophysical problems characterized by diverse observation networks and various dynamic instabilities, such as numerical weather prediction models. Significance Statement Data assimilation statistically processes observation errors and model forecast errors to provide optimal initial conditions for the forecast, playing a critical role in numerical weather forecasting. The ensemble Kalman filter, which has been widely adopted and developed in many operational centers, assumes Gaussianity of the prior distribution and solves a linear system of equations, leading to bias in strong nonlinear regimes. On the other hand, particle filters avoid many of those assumptions but are sensitive to sampling errors and are computationally expensive. We propose an adaptive hybrid strategy that combines their advantages and minimizes the disadvantages of the two methods. The hybrid particle filter–ensemble Kalman filter is achieved with the Shapiro–Wilk test to detect the Gaussianity of the ensemble members and determine the timing of the transition between these filter updates. Demonstrations in this study show that the proposed method is advantageous when observations are heterogeneous and when the model has an unknown bias. Furthermore, by extending the statistical hypothesis test to the test for multivariate normality, we consider marginals of more than one collocated variable. These results encourage further testing for real geophysical problems characterized by various dynamic instabilities, such as real numerical weather prediction models.",

Recently, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), a widely used data assimilation resource that supports the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, was facilitated with an interface for the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV), which supports radiance assimilation from visible (VIS) to microwave wavelength channels. This study evaluates the WRF (ARW v4.1.1)/DART (Manhattan release v9.8.0)-RTTOV (v12.3) system for assimilating the radiance data of channel 2 (0.55~0.75 &mu;m) of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FY-4. Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) were performed for a cyclone case. The results indicate that assimilating VIS radiance data improves cloud forecast skills in general. Best results were achieved for the data assimilation (DA) experiment with dense observations and high updating frequency. The best results could capture the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; structure of the cyclone system and significantly improves cloud water path and cloud coverage simulations. Nevertheless, three main problems were revealed. The first is its inability to improve cloud vertical distribution such as layered structures and cloud phases; The second is the its inability to influence atmosphere thermodynamic state variables positively; The third is a waste of up to 50 % observations during the filtering processes.</p>",

		"abstract": "It is widely recognized that the initial ensemble describes the uncertainty of the variables and, thus, affects the performance of ensemble-based assimilation techniques, which is investigated in this paper with experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) assimilation software. Five perturbation strategies involving adding noises of different patterns and with/without extra integration are compared in the observation system simulation experiments framework, in which the SST is assimilated with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter method. The comparison results show that for the observed variables (sea surface temperature), the differences in the initial ensemble lead to different rate of convergence in the assimilation, but all experiments reach convergence after three months. However, other variables (sea surface height and sea surface salinity) are more sensitive to the initial ensemble. The analysis of variance results reveal that the white-noise perturbation scheme has the largest RMSE. After excluding the effect of the white noise perturbation scheme, it can be found that the difference in the effect of different initial ensembles on the SSH with only assimilated SST is concentrated in the region of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which is related to the spread of the covariance between the SSH and the SST.",

		"abstract": "The largest obstacle to managing satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) is accurately forecasting the neutral mass densities that appreciably impact atmospheric drag. Empirical thermospheric models are often used to estimate neutral densities but they struggle to forecast neutral densities during geomagnetic storms when they are highly variable. Physics-based models are thus increasingly turned to for their ability to describe the dynamical evolution of neutral densities. However, these models require observations to constrain dynamical state variables to be able to forecast mass densities with adequate fidelity. The LEO environment has scarce neutral state observations. Here, we demonstrate, in simulated experiments, a reduction in orbit errors and neutral densities using a physics-based, data assimilation approach with ionospheric observations. Using a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model, the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, we assimilate Constellation Observing System for Meterology, Ionosphere, and Climate electron density profiles (EDPs) derived from radio occultation (RO) observations. We use the EDPs to directly update neutral states, improving errors for neutral temperature by 70% and neutral winds by 20%. Updated neutral temperature and neutral winds additionally improve helium composition errors by 60% and 40%, respectively. Improved neutral density estimates correspond to a reduction in orbit errors of 1.2 km over 2 days, a 70% reduction over a no-assimilation control, and a 29 km improvement over 9 days. This study builds on the results of our earlier work to further develop and demonstrate the potential of using a vast and growing RO data source, with a physics-based model, to overcome our limited number of neutral observations.",

		"abstract": "Carbon, water and energy exchange between the land and atmosphere controls how ecosystems either accelerate or ameliorate the effect of climate change. However, evaluating improvements to processes controlling carbon cycling, water use and energy exchange in global land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging in part because of persistent model errors in estimating leaf area. Here we evaluate the changes in global carbon, water and energy exchange brought about when a LSM prognostic estimates of leaf area are made consistent with estimates from satellites. This approach achieves two aims; first to quantify the effect of ignoring errors in leaf area index (LAI) on land-atmosphere fluxes and second, to evaluate how closely this LSM replicates fluxes with and without an LAI constraint. We implemented an ensemble Kalman filter with spatiotemporal adaptive inflation to more closely match community land model (CLM5.0) estimates of leaf area to those from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies leaf area index (LAI3g) product. We then evaluate the model's estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) against well established global estimates of these fluxes. We find that the model is biased high by 27% relative to the LAI3g product. Moreover, the effect of bias in LAI is substantial for GPP (18%) and LE (6%) and likely to confound efforts to refine processes controlling these fluxes. This data assimilation approach serves as a method to evaluate the efficacy of refinements to flux processes until the processes controlling the dynamics of LAI are better resolved in LSMs.",

In the TRANSCOM land regions, the NBEs of temperate N. America, northern Africa, and boreal Asia are between the estimates of CMS-Flux NBE 2020 and CT2019B, and those in temperate Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia are consistent with CMS-Flux NBE 2020 but significantly different from CT2019B. In the RECCAP2 regions, except for Africa and South Asia, the NBEs are comparable with the latest bottom-up estimate of Ciais et al. (2021). Compared with previous studies, the IAVs and seasonal cycles of NEE of this dataset could clearly reflect the impacts of extreme climates and large-scale climate anomalies on the carbon flux. The evaluations also show that the posterior CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> concentrations at remote sites and on a regional scale, as well as on vertical CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> profiles in the Asia-Pacific region, are all consistent with independent CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> measurements from surface flask and aircraft CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> observations, indicating that this dataset captures surface carbon fluxes well. We believe that this dataset can contribute to regional- or national-scale carbon cycle and carbon neutrality assessment and carbon dynamics research.

		"abstract": "Ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) uses sample statistics of ensemble forecasts to estimate relationships between forecast metrics and initial conditions. The ensemble sensitivity analysis is often considered as a simple univariate regression as it includes an approximation of analysis covariance matrix with corresponding diagonal elements. In this work, univariate ensemble sensitivity is extended to multivariate ensemble sensitivity that incorporates the contribution from the full covariance matrix in the sensitivity calculations. The performance of multivariate ensemble sensitivity over univariate is examined for meso- and convective scale ensemble forecasts of a heavy rainfall event that happened over the Chennai city in India in December 2015. The ensemble forecasts and analyses are generated using the Advanced Research - Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) based Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Multivariate ensemble sensitivity shows organized sensitivity patterns, while the sensitivity values are found to be broadly distributed in univariate ensemble sensitivity. Both the methods are validated using a perturbed initial condition approach, and the results indicate that the multivariate ensemble sensitivity method is effective in predicting the forecast response closest to the actual model response compared to the univariate ensemble sensitivity. The impact of model error on sensitivity calculations is examined by generating a new set of ensembles that uses the Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter Scheme (SKEBS). In the presence of added model error, the forecast response estimated by multivariate using SKEBS ensembles compares better with the actual response. It is found that the performance of the multivariate approach depends on the optimal choice of localization radius, and if insufficient localization is applied, the spurious long-distance correlation contaminates the performance of the multivariate ensemble sensitivity method. The impact of various forecast lead times on the univariate and multivariate ensemble sensitivity analysis indicates that responses using multivariate ensemble sensitivity are more accurate than univariate, especially at longer lead times when nonlinearity becomes significant. The performance of univariate and multivariate methods in convection-permitting scale is examined by using the high-resolution ensemble forecasts, and it is found that the multivariate sensitivity with localization substantially improves the estimates in finer scales.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The current GFDL seasonal prediction system, the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR), has shown skillful prediction of Arctic sea ice extent with atmosphere and ocean constrained by observations. In this study we present improvements in subseasonal and seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice by directly assimilating sea ice observations. The sea ice initial conditions from a data assimilation (DA) system that assimilates satellite sea ice concentration (SIC) observations are used to produce a set of reforecast experiments (IceDA) starting from the first day of each month from 1992 to 2017. Our evaluation of daily sea ice extent prediction skill concludes that the SPEAR system generally outperforms the anomaly persistence forecast at lead times beyond 1 month. We primarily focus our analysis on daily gridcell-level sea ice fields. SIC DA improves prediction skill of SIC forecasts prominently in the June-, July-, August-, and September-initialized reforecasts. We evaluate two additional user-oriented metrics: the ice-free probability (IFP) and ice-free date (IFD). IFP is the probability of a grid cell experiencing ice-free conditions in a given year, and IFD is the first date on which a grid cell is ice free. A combined analysis of IFP and IFD demonstrates that the SPEAR model can make skillful predictions of local ice melt as early as May, with modest improvements from SIC DA.",

		"abstract": "The study of anthropogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is crucial to investigate anthropogenic activities. Assuming the anthropogenic CO emissions accounted for the super majority of the winter CO fluxes in western Europe, they could be roughly estimated by the inversion approach. The CO fluxes and concentrations of four consecutive winter seasons (i.e., December–February) in western Europe since 2017 were estimated by a regional CO flux inversion system based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The CO retrievals from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere instrument (MOPITT) version 8 level 2 multi-spectral Thermal InfraRed (TIR)/Near-InfraRed (NIR) CO retrieval data products were assimilated by the inversion system. The analyses of the MOPITT data used by the inversion system indicated that the mean averaging kernel row sums of the surface level was about 0.25, and the difference percentage of the surface-level retrievals relative to a priori CO-mixing ratios was 14.79%, which was similar to that of the other levels. These results suggested the MOPITT’s surface-level observations contained roughly the same amount of information as the other levels. The inverted CO fluxes of the four winter seasons were 6198.15 kilotons, 4939.72 kilotons, 4697.80 kilotons, and 5456.19 kilotons, respectively. Based on the assumption, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventories were used to evaluate the accuracy of the inverted CO fluxes. The evaluation results indicated that the differences between the inverted CO fluxes and UNFCCC inventories of the three winter seasons of 2017–2019 were 13.36%, −4.59%, and −4.76%, respectively. Detailed surface-CO concentrations and XCO comparative analyses between the experimental results and the external Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-Chem) results and the MOPITT data were conducted. The comparative analysis results indicated that the experimental results of the winter season of 2017 were obviously affected by high boundary conditions. The CO concentrations results of the experiments were also evaluated by the CO observation data from Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), the average Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the CO concentrations results of the inversion system, and the ICOS observations were −22.43 ppb and 57.59 ppb, respectively. The MBE and RMSE of the inversion system were 17.53-ppb and 4.17-ppb better than those of the simulation-only parallel experiments, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A general framework for deterministic univariate ensemble filtering is presented. The framework fits a continuous prior probability density function (PDF) to the prior ensemble. A functional representation for the observation likelihood is combined with the prior PDF to get a continuous analysis (posterior) PDF. Cumulative distribution functions for the prior and analysis are also required. The key innovation is that an analysis ensemble is computed so that the quantile of each ensemble member is the same as its prior quantile. Many choices for the prior PDF family and the likelihood function are described. A choice of normal prior with normal likelihood is equivalent to the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Some other choices for the prior include gamma, inverse gamma, beta, beta prime, lognormal, and exponential distributions. Both prior distributions and likelihoods can be defined over a set of intervals giving additional flexibility that can be used to implement methods like a Huber likelihood for observations with occasional outliers. Priors and likelihoods can also be defined as sums of distributions allowing choices like bivariate normals or kernel filters. Empirical distributions, for instance piecewise linear approximations to arbitrary PDFs and functions can be used. Another empirical choice leads to the rank histogram filter. Results here are univariate and can be used to compute increments for observed variables or marginal distributions for any variable for a reanalysis. Linear regression of increments can be used to update state variables in a serial filter to build a comprehensive data assimilation system. Part 2 will discuss other methods for extending the framework to multivariate data assimilation. Significance Statement Data assimilation is used to combine information from model forecasts with subsequent observations to obtain better estimates of the current state of the atmosphere or other parts of the Earth system. Ensemble data assimilation uses a number of forecasts to get more information about uncertainty. A new method allows much more flexibility in the assumptions that must be made when doing ensemble data assimilation. As an example, the method can be better for quantities that are bounded like the amount of an atmospheric trace pollutant.",

The observations are assimilated into the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Assimilation of the COSMIC-2 electron density profiles during the evaluation time period of 25–30 April 2020 leads to improvement in both the 1 hr forecast and analysis electron densities in WACCMX + DART. Compared to a control experiment that does not assimilate COSMIC-2 observations, the assimilation of the COSMIC-2 electron density profiles reduces the 1 hr forecast root mean square error (RMSE) and bias with respect to COSMIC-2 observations at 300 km by 6.76% and 24.91%, respectively. Assimilation of the COSMIC-2 electron density profiles does not significantly influence the RMSE and bias with respect to ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System vertical total electron content observations. The equatorial vertical plasma drift velocity in WACCMX + DART is changed by ±5–10 ms−1 due to the assimilation of the COSMIC-2 electron density profiles, indicating that the model representation of the electrodynamics of the low latitude ionosphere are significantly impacted by the assimilation of COSMIC-2 observations.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The Community Earth System Model (CESM) developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been used worldwide for climate studies. This study extends the efforts of CESM development to include an online (i.e., in-core) ensemble coupled data assimilation system (CESM-ECDA) to enhance CESM's capability for climate predictability studies and prediction applications. The CESM-ECDA system consists of an online atmospheric data assimilation (ADA) component implemented in both the finite-volume and spectral-element dynamical cores and an online ocean data assimilation (ODA) component. In ADA, surface pressures (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>P</i><sub>s</sub></span>) are assimilated, while in ODA, gridded sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean temperature and salinity profiles at real Argo locations are assimilated. The system has been evaluated within a perfect twin experiment framework, showing significantly reduced errors of the model atmosphere and ocean states through “observation” constraints by ADA and ODA. The weakly coupled data assimilation (CDA) in which both the online ADA and ODA are conducted during the coupled model integration shows smaller errors of air–sea fluxes than the single ADA and ODA, facilitating the future utilization of cross-covariance between the atmosphere and ocean at the air–sea interface. A 3-year CDA reanalysis experiment is also implemented by assimilating <span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>P</i><sub>s</sub></span>, SST and ocean temperature and salinity profiles from the real world spanning the period 1978 to 1980 using 12 ensemble members. The success of the online CESM-ECDA system is the first step to implementing a high-resolution long-term climate reanalysis once the algorithm efficiency is much improved.</p>",

		"abstract": "The covariance matrix estimated from the ensemble data assimilation always suffers from filter collapse because of the spurious correlations induced by the finite ensemble size. The localization technique is applied to ameliorate this issue, which has been suggested to be effective. In this paper, an adaptive scheme for Schur product covariance localization is proposed, which is easy and efficient to implement in the ensemble data assimilation frameworks. A Gaussian-shaped taper function is selected as the localization taper function for the Schur product in the adaptive localization scheme, and the localization radius is obtained adaptively through a certain criterion of correlations with the background ensembles. An idealized Lorenz96 model with an ensemble Kalman filter is firstly examined, showing that the adaptive localization scheme helps to significantly reduce the spurious correlations in the small ensemble with low computational cost and provides accurate covariances that are similar to those derived from a much larger ensemble. The investigations of adaptive localization radius reveal that the optimal radius is model-parameter-dependent, vertical-level-dependent and nearly flow-dependent with weather scenarios in a realistic model; for example, the radius of model parameter zonal wind is generally larger than that of temperature. The adaptivity of the localization scheme is also illustrated in the ensemble framework and shows that the adaptive scheme has a positive effect on the assimilated analysis as the well-tuned localization.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Ensemble Kalman filters use the sample covariance of an observation and a model state variable to update a prior estimate of the state variable. The sample covariance can be suboptimal as a result of small ensemble size, model error, model nonlinearity, and other factors. The most common algorithms for dealing with these deficiencies are inflation and covariance localization. A statistical model of errors in ensemble Kalman filter sample covariances is described and leads to an algorithm that reduces ensemble filter root-mean-square error for some applications. This sampling error correction algorithm uses prior information about the distribution of the correlation between an observation and a state variable. Offline Monte Carlo simulation is used to build a lookup table that contains a correction factor between 0 and 1 depending on the ensemble size and the ensemble sample correlation. Correction factors are applied like a traditional localization for each pair of observations and state variables during an ensemble assimilation. The algorithm is applied to two low-order models and reduces the sensitivity of the ensemble assimilation error to the strength of traditional localization. When tested in perfect model experiments in a larger model, the dynamical core of a general circulation model, the sampling error correction algorithm produces analyses that are closer to the truth and also reduces sensitivity to traditional localization strength.",

When working in a joint state–observation space, many features of ensemble filtering algorithms are easier to derive and compare. The ensemble filter methods derived here make a (local) least squares assumption about the relation between prior distributions of an observation variable and model state variables. In this context, the update procedure applied when a new observation becomes available can be described in two parts. First, an update increment is computed for each prior ensemble estimate of the observation variable by applying a scalar ensemble filter. Second, a linear regression of the prior ensemble sample of each state variable on the observation variable is performed to compute update increments for each state variable ensemble member from corresponding observation variable increments. The regression can be applied globally or locally using Gaussian kernel methods. Several previously documented ensemble Kalman filter methods, the perturbed observation ensemble Kalman filter and ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, are developed in this context. Some new ensemble filters that extend beyond the Kalman filter context are also discussed. The two-part method can provide a computationally efficient implementation of ensemble filters and allows more straightforward comparison of methods since they differ only in the solution of a scalar filtering problem.",

Utilizing an ensemble-based data assimilation technique, the GPS-PWV data retrieved from 18 observation sites are assimilated every hour for 12 hours into a 30-member ensemble convective-permitting (2.5 km) Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model. As the assimilation of the GPS-PWV improves the initial condition of WRF by reducing the root mean square error and bias of PWV across 1200-1800 UTC, this also leads to an improvement in capturing nocturnal convection of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs; after 0300 UTC) and to an increase by 0.1 mm h<sup>-1</sup> in subsequent precipitation during the 0300-0600 UTC period relative to no assimilation of the GPS-PWV (NODA) over the area with relatively more observation sites. This response is consistent with observed precipitation from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Final Precipitation product. Moreover, compared to the NODA, we find that the GPS-PWV DA decreases cloud top temperature, increases most unstable convective available energy and surface dewpoint temperature, and thus creates a more favorable condition for convective organization in the region.</p></section>",

A total of 26 diurnal and semidiurnal tidal components are calculated using the latest hourly data assimilation cycling during January 12–March 15, 2009 time period. When averaged over this entire yaw cycle, most tidal components display a latitudinal and vertical structures similar to that observed by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER). However, WACCMX + DART amplitudes of some diurnal tidal components are a factor of ∼1.2–2 times smaller and the peak altitudes and latitudes are shifted compared to SABER. The amplitudes of semidiurnal tides are likewise underestimated in the model, as well as being shifted in altitude and latitude, and some wavenumbers are not captured. Daily tidal variations are calculated in the model and compared with SABER and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar observations. Both the model and the radars show an amplification of the migrating semidiurnal tide during the week following the peak SSW. Enhancements in nonmigrating diurnal tides are also shown around the SSW peak, which could be produced by the nonlinear interaction between migrating tides and planetary waves. This study finds that, despite using data assimilation to constrain model dynamics, more work is needed in order to accurately simulate the full tidal spectrum and responses to SSWs in the MLT region.",

This paper focuses on understanding the evolution of the vertical structure of the storm, the outflow buoyancy, and processes affecting the vertical vorticity and circulation within the mesocyclone that correspond to changes in observed tornado intensity.</p><p>Tornadogenesis occurs when the low-level mesocyclone is least negatively buoyant relative to the environment, possesses its largest circulation, and is collocated with the largest azimuthally averaged convergence during the analysis period. The average buoyancy, circulation, and convergence within the near-surface mesocyclone (on spatial scales resolved by the model) all decrease as the tornado intensifies and matures. The tornado and its parent low-level mesocyclone both dissipate surrounded by a weakening rear-flank downdraft. The decreasing buoyancy of parcels within the low-level mesocyclone may partly be responsible for the weakening of the updraft surrounding the tornado and decoupling of the mid- and low-level circulation. Although the supply of horizontal vorticity generated in the forward flank of the storm increases throughout the life cycle of the tornado, it is presumably less easily tilted and stretched on the mesocyclone-scale during tornado maturity owing to the disruption of the low-level updraft/downdraft structure. Changes in radar-measured tornado intensity lag those of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) mesocyclone vorticity and circulation.</p></section>",

For both cases, the members with stronger convection are characterized by higher water vapor just above the top of the boundary layer, which is associated with lower convective inhibition (CIN) at the time of CI. Forecast convection is sensitive to the lower-tropospheric water vapor and zonal wind at earlier lead times farther south along the dryline, such that increasing the water vapor and/or making the wind more easterly is associated with more convection. For 28 May, the water vapor along the dryline is also sensitive to the convection that occurs around 0600 UTC, which leads to cold pool–induced surface divergence that subsequently shifts the dryline north or south. Ensemble members that correctly have decreased convection in the Texas Panhandle on 28 May have more accurate forecasts of water vapor and meridional wind with respect to dropwindsondes in the sensitive region 9 h prior to CI compared to members with more extensive convection. Reducing the 0-h water vapor within the sensitive region can suppress convection in members with extensive convection; however, increasing the 0-h water vapor does not lead to more convection in members without convection.</p></section>",

Subensembles composed of 20–30 members usually demonstrated comparable resolution, reliability, and skill as the full 50-member ensemble. On average, deterministic forecasts initialized from mean EnKF analyses were at least as or more skillful than forecasts initialized from individual ensemble members “closest” to the mean EnKF analyses, and “patched together” forecasts composed of members closest to the ensemble mean during each forecast interval were skillful but came with caveats.

In particular, convection-permitting ensemble forecast systems (CPEFSs) have persistent problems with underdispersion. Representing initial and or lateral boundary condition uncertainty along with forecast model error provides a foundation for building a more dependable CPEFS, but the best practice for ensemble system design is not well established.</p><p>Several configurations of CPEFSs are examined where ensemble forecasts are nested within a larger domain, drawing initial conditions from a downscaled, continuously cycled, ensemble data assimilation system that provides state-dependent initial condition uncertainty. The control ensemble forecast, with initial condition uncertainty only, is skillful but underdispersive. To improve the reliability of the ensemble forecasts, the control ensemble is supplemented with 1) perturbed lateral boundary conditions; or, model error representation using either 2) stochastic kinetic energy backscatter or 3) stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies. Forecasts are evaluated against stage IV accumulated precipitation analyses and radiosonde observations. Perturbed ensemble forecasts are also compared to the control forecast to assess the relative impact from adding forecast perturbations. For precipitation forecasts, all perturbation approaches improve ensemble reliability relative to the control CPEFS. Deterministic ensemble member forecast skill, verified against radiosonde observations, decreases when forecast perturbations are added, while ensemble mean forecasts remain similarly skillful to the control.</p></section>",

Two experiments spanning 11 August–13 September 2008 were run over a domain featuring the Atlantic basin using a 6-h full cycling analysis and forecast system. Deterministic 72-h forecasts were initialized at 0000 and 1200 UTC for a comparison of forecast impact. The two experiments were configured identically with the exception of the inclusion of the MHS radiances (AMHS) in the second to isolate the impacts of the MHS radiance data. The results were verified against several sources, and statistical significance tests indicate the most notable differences are in the midlevel moisture fields. Both configurations were characterized by high moisture biases when compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim, also known as ERA-I) specific humidity fields, as well as precipitable water vapor from an observationally based product. However, the AMHS experiment has midlevel moisture fields closer to the ERA-I and observation datasets. When reducing the verification domain to focus on the subtropical and easterly wave regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, larger improvements in midlevel moisture at nearly all lead times is seen in the AMHS simulation. Finally, when considering tropical cyclone forecasts, the AMHS configuration shows improvement in intensity forecasts at several lead times as well as improvements at early to intermediate lead times for minimum sea level pressure forecasts.</p></section>",

The DR hybrid analyses initialized 72-h WRF Model forecasts that were compared to forecasts initialized by an SR hybrid system where both the ensemble and background had 15-km horizontal grid spacing.

The ensemble forecasts were initialized twice daily at 0000 and 1200 UTC from analysis members of a continuously cycling, limited-area, mesoscale (15 km) ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system and evaluated with a focus on precipitation and severe weather guidance. Deterministic WRF Model forecasts initialized from GFS analyses were also examined. Subjectively, the ensemble forecasts often produced areas of intense convection over regions where severe weather was observed. Objective statistics confirmed these subjective impressions and indicated that the ensemble was skillful at predicting precipitation and severe weather events. Forecasts initialized at 1200 UTC were more skillful regarding precipitation and severe weather placement than forecasts initialized 12 h earlier at 0000 UTC, and the ensemble forecasts were typically more skillful than GFS-initialized forecasts. At times, 0000 UTC GFS-initialized forecasts had temporal distributions of domain-average rainfall closer to observations than EnKF-initialized forecasts. However, particularly when GFS analyses initialized WRF Model forecasts, 1200 UTC forecasts produced more rainfall during the first diurnal maximum than 0000 UTC forecasts. This behavior was mostly attributed to WRF Model initialization of clouds and moist physical processes. The success of these real-time ensemble forecasts demonstrates the feasibility of using limited-area continuously cycling EnKFs as a method to initialize convection-allowing ensemble forecasts, and future real-time high-resolution ensemble development leveraging EnKFs seems justified.</p></section>",

		"abstract": "Abstract Forecasting mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and precipitation over complex terrain is an ongoing challenge even for convective-permitting numerical models. Here, we show the value of combining mesoscale constraints to improve short-term MCS forecasts for two events during the North American monsoon season in 2013, including the following: 1) the initial specification of moisture, via GPS-precipitable water vapor (PWV) data assimilation (DA); 2) kinematics via modification of cumulus parameterization; and 3) microphysics via modification of cloud microphysics parameterization. A total of five convective-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model experiments is conducted for each event to elucidate the impact of these constraints. Results show that combining GPS-PWV DA with a modified Kain–Fritsch scheme and double-moment microphysics provides relatively the best forecast of both North American monsoon MCSs and convective precipitation in terms of timing, location, and intensity relative to available precipitation and cloud-top temperature observations. Additional examination on the associated reflectivity, vertical wind field, equivalent potential temperature, and hydrometeor distribution of MCS events show the added value of each individual constraint to forecast performance. Significance Statement Forecasting thunderstorm clouds and rain over mountainous regions is challenging because of limitations in having radar and rain gauges and in resolving physical drivers in forecast models. We examine the value of considering all possible constraints by incorporating moisture into these models, and correcting physics in the model treatment of cumulus and cloud microphysics parameterizations. This study demonstrates that assimilating moisture and using modified Kain–Fritsch and double-moment microphysics schemes provides the best thunderstorm cloud and rain forecasts in terms of timing, location, and intensity. Each correction improves key properties of these storms such as vertical wind, along with distribution of water in various phases. We highlight the need to improve our efforts on effectively integrating these constraints into current and future forecasts.",

In this context, we developed an ensemble data assimilation system to optimize the initial conditions for carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols, while also quantifying the respective emission fluxes with a distinct attribution of anthropogenic and wildfire sources. We present the separate assimilation of CO profile v9 retrievals from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), collection 6.1, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. This assimilation system is built on the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and includes a meteorological ensemble to assimilate weather observations within the online Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-chem). Inversions indicate an underestimation of CO emissions in CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v5.1 in China for 2015 and an overestimation of CO emissions in the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) version 2.2, especially in the tropics. These emissions increments are consistent between the MODIS AOD and the MOPITT CO-based inversions. Additional simulations and comparison with in situ observations from the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) show that biases in hydroxyl radical (OH) chemistry dominate the CO errors.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Traditional ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methods make implicit assumptions of Gaussianity and linearity that are strongly violated by many important Earth system applications. For instance, bounded quantities like the amount of a tracer and sea ice fractional coverage cannot be accurately represented by a Gaussian that is unbounded by definition. Nonlinear relations between observations and model state variables abound. Examples include the relation between a remotely sensed radiance and the column of atmospheric temperatures, or the relation between cloud amount and water vapor quantity. Part I of this paper described a very general data assimilation framework for computing observation increments for non-Gaussian prior distributions and likelihoods. These methods can respect bounds and other non-Gaussian aspects of observed variables. However, these benefits can be lost when observation increments are used to update state variables using the linear regression that is part of standard ensemble Kalman filter algorithms. Here, regression of observation increments is performed in a space where variables are transformed by the probit and probability integral transforms, a specific type of Gaussian anamorphosis. This method can enforce appropriate bounds for all quantities and deal much more effectively with nonlinear relations between observations and state variables. Important enhancements like localization and inflation can be performed in the transformed space. Results are provided for idealized bivariate distributions and for cycling assimilation in a low-order dynamical system. Implications for improved data assimilation across Earth system applications are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Assimilation of Doppler radar data into cloud models is an important obstacle to routine numerical weather prediction for convective-scale motions; the difficulty lies in initializing fields of wind, temperature, moisture, and condensate given only observations of radial velocity and reflectivity from the radar. This paper investigates the potential of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which estimates the covariances between observed variables and the state through an ensemble of forecasts, to assimilate radar observations at convective scales. In the basic experiment, simulated observations are extracted from a reference simulation of a splitting supercell and assimilated using the EnKF and the same numerical model that produced the reference simulation. The EnKF produces accurate analyses, including the unobserved variables, after roughly 30 min (or six scans) of radial velocity observations. Additional experiments, in which forecasts are made from the ensemble-mean analysis, reveal that forecast errors grow significantly in this simple system, so that the ability of the EnKF to track the reference solution is not simply because of stable system dynamics. It is also found that the covariances between radial velocity and temperature, moisture, and condensate are important to the quality of the analyses, as is the initialization chosen for the ensemble members prior to assimilating the first observations. These results are promising, especially given the ease of implementing the EnKF. A number of important issues remain, however, including the initialization of the ensemble prior to the first observation, the treatment of uncertainty in the environmental sounding, the role of error in the forecast model (particularly the microphysical parameterizations), and the treatment of lateral boundary conditions.",

		"abstract": "The background error covariance (correlation) between model state variables is of central importance for implementing data assimilation and understanding model dynamics. Traditional approaches for estimating the background error covariance involve many heuristic approximations, and often the estimated covariance is flow-independent, i.e. only reflecting statistics of the climatological background. This study examines temporally and spatially varying estimates of error covariance in a spectral barotropic model using a Monte Carlo approach, an implementation of an ensemble square root filter called the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). The EAKF is designed to maintain as much information about the distribution of the prior state variables as possible, and results show that this method can produce reasonable estimates of error correlation structure with an affordable sample (ensemble) size. The impact of using temporally and spatially varying estimates of error covariance in the EAKF is examined by using the time and spatial mean error covariances derived from the EAKF in an ensemble optimal interpolation (OI) assimilation scheme. Three key results are: (1) for the same ensemble size, an ensemble filter such as the EAKF produces better assimilations since its flow-dependent error covariance estimates are able to reflect more about the synoptic-scale wave structure in the simulated flows; (2) an ensemble OI scheme can also produce reasonably good assimilation results if the time-invariate covariance matrix is chosen appropriately; (3) when using the EAKF to estimate the error covariance matrix for improving traditional assimilation algorithms such as variational analysis and OI, a relatively small ensemble size may be used to estimate correlation structure although larger ensembles produce progressively better results.",

Both identical-model and imperfect-model twin experiments are analyzed, and they show distinctive differences from the classical inverse cascade picture of predictability error growth. In the identical-model twin framework, error growth experiments using initial errors confined to long and short scales are compared and contrasted. In these cases, error growth eventually asymptotes to an exponential growth of baroclinically active scales. In the imperfect-model twin experiments, errors rapidly disperse from scales technically beyond model resolution to a small amplitude, spectrally uniform distribution of errors in resolved scales. The errors in resolved scales further amplify in a quasi-exponential growth of the baroclinically active scales. Finally, the implications of these growth mechanisms for the necessary resolution in short- to medium-range numerical weather prediction are given under the assumption that the accuracy of current initial state estimates of the atmosphere remain fixed at their present level.",

		"abstract": "Many geophysical problems are characterized by high-dimensional, nonlinear systems and pose difficult challenges for real-time data assimilation (updating) and forecasting. The present work builds on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnsKF), with the goal of producing ensemble filtering techniques applicable to non-Gaussian densities and high-dimensional systems. Three filtering algorithms, based on representing the prior density as a Gaussian mixture, are presented. The first, referred to as a mixture ensemble Kalman filter (XEnsF), models local covariance structures adaptively using nearest neighbors. The XEnsF is effective in a three-dimensional system, but the required ensemble grows rapidly with the dimension and, even in a 40-dimensional system, we find the XEnsF to be unstable and inferior to the EnsKF for all computationally feasible ensemble sizes. A second algorithm, the local-local ensemble filter (LLEnsF), combines localizations in physical as well as phase space, allowing the update step in high-dimensional systems to be decomposed into a sequence of lower-dimensional updates tractable by the XEnsF. Given the same prior forecasts in a 40-dimensional system, the LLEnsF update produces more accurate state estimates than the EnsKF if the forecast distributions are sufficiently non-Gaussian. Cycling the LLEnsF for long times, however, produces results inferior to the EnsKF because the LLEnsF ignores spatial continuity or smoothness between local state estimates. To address this weakness of the LLEnsF, we consider ways of enforcing spatial smoothness by conditioning the local updates on the prior estimates outside the localization in physical space. These considerations yield a third algorithm, which is a hybrid of the LLEnsF and the EnsKF. The hybrid uses information from the EnsKF to ensure spatial continuity of local updates and outperforms the EnsKF by 5.7% in RMS error in the 40-dimensional system.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) uses an ensemble of short-range forecasts to estimate the flow-dependent background error covariances required in data assimilation. The feasibility of the EnKF for convective-scale data assimilation has been previously demonstrated in perfect-model experiments using simulated observations of radial velocity from a supercell storm. The present study further explores the potential and behavior of the EnKF at convective scales by considering more realistic initial analyses and variations in the availability and quality of the radar observations. Assimilation of simulated radial-velocity observations every 5 min where there is significant reflectivity using 20 ensemble members proves to be successful in most realistic observational scenarios for simulated supercell thunderstorms, although the same degree of success may not be readily expected with real observations and an imperfect model, at least with the present EnKF implementation. Even though the filter converges toward the truth simulation faster from a better initial estimate, an experiment with the initial estimate of the supercell displaced by 10 km still yields an accurate estimate of the storm for both observed and unobserved variables within 40 min. Similarly, radial-velocity observations below 2 km are certainly beneficial to capturing the storm (especially the detailed cold pool structure), but in their absence the assimilation scheme can still achieve a comparably accurate estimate of the state of the storm given a slightly longer assimilation period. An experiment with radar observations only above 4 km fails to assimilate the storm properly, but, with the addition of a hypothetical surface mesonet taking wind and temperature observations, the EnKF can again provide a good estimate of the storm. The supercell can also be successfully assimilated in the case of radar observations only below 4 km (such as those from the ground-based mobile radars). More frequent observations can help the storm assimilation initially, but the benefit diminishes after half an hour. Results presented here indicate that the vertical resolution and the uncertainty of observations, for the typical range of most of the observational radars, would have little impact on the overall performance of the EnKF in assimilating the storm.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An ensemble filter data assimilation system is tested in a perfect model setting using a low resolution Held–Suarez configuration of an atmospheric GCM. The assimilation system is able to reconstruct details of the model’s state at all levels when only observations of surface pressure (PS) are available. The impacts of varying the spatial density and temporal frequency of PS observations are examined. The error of the ensemble mean assimilation prior estimate appears to saturate at some point as the number of PS observations available once every 24 h is increased. However, increasing the frequency with which PS observations are available from a fixed network of 1800 randomly located stations results in an apparently unbounded decrease in the assimilation’s prior error for both PS and all other model state variables. The error reduces smoothly as a function of observation frequency except for a band with observation periods around 4 h. Assimilated states are found to display enhanced amplitude high-frequency gravity wave oscillations when observations are taken once every few hours, and this adversely impacts the assimilation quality. Assimilations of only surface temperature and only surface wind components are also examined. The results indicate that, in a perfect model context, ensemble filters are able to extract surprising amounts of information from observations of only a small portion of a model’s spatial domain. This suggests that most of the remaining challenges for ensemble filter assimilation are confined to problems such as model error, observation representativeness error, and unknown instrument error characteristics that are outside the scope of perfect model experiments. While it is dangerous to extrapolate from these simple experiments to operational atmospheric assimilation, the results also suggest that exploring the frequency with which observations are used for assimilation may lead to significant enhancements to assimilated state estimates.",

The simple linear updating scheme used in the EnKF is effective for small displacements of forecasted vortices from the true position; this situation is operationally relevant since hurricane position is often available frequently in time. When displacements of the forecasted vortices are comparable to the vortex size, non-Gaussian effects become significant and the EnKF’s linear update begins to degrade. Simulations using a simple two-dimensional barotropic model demonstrate the potential of the technique and show that the track forecast initialized with the EnKF analysis is improved. The assimilation of observations of the vortex shape and intensity, along with position, extends the technique’s effectiveness to larger displacements of the forecasted vortices than when assimilating position alone.",

A two-dimensional, nonlinear, hydrostatic, nonrotating, and incompressible sea-breeze model is used for this purpose with buoyancy and vorticity as the prognostic variables and a square root filter with covariance localization is employed. To control filter divergence caused by the narrowing of parameter variance, a “conditional covariance inflation” method is devised. Up to six model parameters are subjected to estimation attempts in various experiments. While the estimation of single imperfect parameters results in error of model variables that is indistinguishable from the respective perfect-parameter cases, increasing the number of estimated parameters to six inevitably leads to a decline in the level of improvement achieved by parameter estimation. However, the overall EnKF performance in terms of the error statistics is still superior to the situation where there is parameter error but no parameter estimation is performed. In fact, compared with that situation, the simultaneous estimation of six parameters reduces the average error in buoyancy and vorticity by 40% and 46%, respectively. Several aspects of the filter configuration (e.g., observation location, ensemble size, radius of influence, and parameter variance limit) are found to considerably influence the identifiability of the parameters. The parameter-dependent response to such factors implies strong nonlinearity between the parameters and the state of the model and suggests that a straightforward spatial covariance localization does not necessarily produce optimality.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The assimilation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies into a coupled ocean–atmosphere model of the tropical Pacific is investigated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). The intermediate coupled model used here is the operational version of the Zebiak–Cane model, called LDEO5. The assimilation is applied as a means of estimating the true state of the system in the presence of incomplete observations of the state. In the first part of this study assimilation is performed under the “perfect model” assumption, where SST observations are synthetically derived from a trajectory of the model. The focus is on how and why changes in the filter parameters (ensemble size, covariance localization, and covariance inflation) affect the quality of the analysis. It is shown that isotropic covariance localization does not benefit the analysis even when a small number of ensemble members are used. These results suggest that destruction of the “balance” between variables caused by localization is more detrimental than spurious correlation due to small ensemble size. In the second part of this study the EAKF is used to assimilate an independent dataset of SST observations. The EAKF/Zebiak–Cane assimilation system is able to correctly estimate the phase and intensity of ENSO, as measured by the average SST anomaly in the eastern equatorial Pacific. A comparison of the analysis herein to independent wind stress and thermocline depth datasets suggests that even with the assimilation of only SST observations it is possible to reproduce over 70% of the interannual variability of thermocline depth in the eastern equatorial Pacific and off the coast of the Philippine Islands. The interannual variability of zonal wind stress in the central and western equatorial Pacific is also well correlated with independent observations (R > 0.75).",

		"abstract": "Abstract Following recent results showing the potential for using surface observations of temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, and winds to determine PBL profiles, this paper reports on experiments with real observations. A 1D column model with soil, surface-layer, and PBL parameterization schemes that are the same as in the Weather Research and Forecasting model is used to estimate PBL profiles with an ensemble filter. Surface observations over the southern Great Plains are assimilated during the spring and early summer period of 2003. To strictly quantify the utility of the observations for determining PBL profiles in the ensemble filter framework, only climatological information is provided for initialization and forcing. The analysis skill, measured against rawinsondes for an independent verification, is compared against climatology to quantify the influence of the observations. Sensitivity to changing parameterization schemes, and to prescribed values of observation error variance, is examined. Temporal propagation of skillful analyses is also assessed, separating the effects of good prior state estimates from the impact of assimilation at night when covariance is weak. Results show that accurate profiles of temperature, mixing ratio, and winds are estimated with the column model and ensemble filter assimilating only surface observations. Results are largely insensitive to choice of parameterization scheme and specified observation error variance. The effects of using different parameterization schemes within the column model depend on whether assimilation is included, showing the importance of evaluating models within assimilation systems. At night, skillful estimates are possible because the influence of the observations from the previous day is temporally propagated, and atmospheric dynamics in the residual layer operate on slow time scales. It is expected that these profiles will have applications for nowcasting and secondary models (e.g., plume dispersion models) that rely on accurate specification of PBL structure.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Strategies to improve covariance estimates for ensemble-based assimilation of near-surface observations in atmospheric models are explored. It is known that localization of covariance estimates can improve conditioning of covariance matrices in the assimilation process by removing spurious elements and increasing the rank of the matrix. Vertical covariance localization is the focus of this work, and two basic approaches are compared: 1) a recently proposed hierarchical filter approach based on sampling theory and 2) a more commonly used fifth-order piecewise rational function. The hierarchical filter allows for dynamic estimates of localization functions and does not place any restrictions on their form. The rational function is optimized for every analysis time of day and for every possible observation and state variable combination. The methods are tested with a column model containing PBL and land surface parameterization schemes that are available in current mesoscale modeling systems. The results are expected to provide context for assimilation of near-surface observations in mesoscale models, which will benefit short-range mesoscale NWP applications. Results show that both the hierarchical and rational function approaches effectively improve covariance estimates from small ensembles. The hierarchical approach provides localization functions that are irregular and more closely related to PBL structure. Analysis of eigenvalue spectra show that both approaches improve the rank of the covariance matrices, but the amount of improvement is not always directly related to the assimilation performance. Results also show that specifying different localization functions for different observation and state variable combinations is more important than including time dependence.",

DART is a community software facility for assimilation studies using the ensemble Kalman filter approach. Here, we apply the assimilation system to constrain global tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) by assimilating meteorological observations of temperature and horizontal wind velocity and satellite CO retrievals from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument. We verify the system performance using independent CO observations taken on board the NSF/NCAR C-130 and NASA DC-8 aircrafts during the April 2006 part of the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-B). Our evaluations show that MOPITT data assimilation provides significant improvements in terms of capturing the observed CO variability relative to no MOPITT assimilation (i.e. the correlation improves from 0.62 to 0.71, significant at 99% confidence). The assimilation provides evidence of median CO loading of about 150 ppbv at 700 hPa over the NE Pacific during April 2006. This is marginally higher than the modeled CO with no MOPITT assimilation (~140 ppbv). Our ensemble-based estimates of model uncertainty also show model overprediction over the source region (i.e. China) and underprediction over the NE Pacific, suggesting model errors that cannot be readily explained by emissions alone. These results have important implications for improving regional chemical forecasts and for inverse modeling of CO sources and further demonstrate the utility of the assimilation system in comparing non-coincident measurements, e.g. comparing satellite retrievals of CO with in-situ aircraft measurements.",

		"abstract": "Ensemble filter methods for combining model prior estimates with observations of a system to produce improved posterior estimates of the system state are nowbeing applied to a wide range of problems both in and out of the geophysics community. Basic implementations of ensemble filters are simple to develop even without any data assimilation expertise. However, obtaining good performance using small ensembles and/or models with significant amounts of error can be more challenging.Anumber of adjunct algorithms have been developed to ameliorate errors in ensemble filters. The most common are covariance inflation and localization which have been used in many applications of ensemble filters. Inflation algorithms modify the prior ensemble estimates of the state variance to reduce filter error and avoid filter divergence. These adjunct algorithms can require considerable tuning for good performance, which can entail significant expense. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to develop an adaptive covariance inflation algorithm for use with ensemble filters. This adaptive error correction algorithm uses the same observations that are used to adjust the ensemble filter estimate of the state to estimate appropriate values of covariance inflation. Results are shown for several low-order model examples and the algorithm produces results that are comparable with the best tuned inflation values, even for small ensembles in the presence of very large model error.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The sensitivity of forecasts to observations is evaluated using an ensemble approach with data drawn from a pseudo-operational ensemble Kalman filter. For Gaussian statistics and a forecast metric defined as a scalar function of the forecast variables, the effect of observations on the forecast metric is quantified by changes in the metric mean and variance. For a single observation, expressions for these changes involve a product of scalar quantities, which can be rapidly evaluated for large numbers of observations. This technique is applied to determining climatological forecast sensitivity and predicting the impact of observations on sea level pressure and precipitation forecast metrics. The climatological 24-h forecast sensitivity of the average pressure over western Washington State shows a region of maximum sensitivity to the west of the region, which tilts gently westward with height. The accuracy of ensemble sensitivity predictions is tested by withholding a single buoy pressure observation from this region and comparing this perturbed forecast with the control case where the buoy is assimilated. For 30 cases, there is excellent agreement between these forecast differences and the ensemble predictions, as measured by the forecast metric. This agreement decreases for increasing numbers of observations. Nevertheless, by using statistical confidence tests to address sampling error, the impact of thousands of observations on forecast-metric variance is shown to be well estimated by a subset of the O(100) most significant observations.",

The goal of smoothing is to make optimal estimates of the geophysical system state making best use of observations taken before, at, and after the analysis time. We begin by reviewing the underlying probabilistic theory, along with a discussion how to implement a smoother using an ensemble Kalman filter algorithm. The novel contribution of this paper is the investigation of various key issues regarding the application of ensemble Kalman filters to smoothing using a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments in both a Lorenz 1996 model and an Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The results demonstrate the impacts of non-linearities, ensemble size, observational network configuration and covariance localization. The Atmospheric General Circulation model results demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) can be successfully applied to high-dimensional estimation problems and that covariance localization plays a critical role in its success. The results of this paper provide a foundation of understanding which will be useful in future applications of EnKS algorithms.",

The nonlocal operator calculates the quasi phase through integration of the model refractivity along the observed ray paths. As a comparison, a local refractivity operator that calculates the model refractivity at the observed ray perigee points is also evaluated. The assimilation is done over North America during January 2003 in two different situations: in conjunction with dense, high-quality radiosonde observations and with only satellite cloud drift wind observations. Analyses of temperature and water vapor with the RO refractivity assimilated using the local and nonlocal operator are verified against nearby withheld radiosonde observations. The bias and RMS errors of the analyses of water vapor and temperature using the nonlocal operator are significantly reduced compared with those using the local operator in the troposphere when the only additional observations are satellite cloud drift winds. The reduction of the bias and RMS errors is reduced when radiosonde observations are assimilated.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Particle filters are ensemble-based assimilation schemes that, unlike the ensemble Kalman filter, employ a fully nonlinear and non-Gaussian analysis step to compute the probability distribution function (pdf) of a system’s state conditioned on a set of observations. Evidence is provided that the ensemble size required for a successful particle filter scales exponentially with the problem size. For the simple example in which each component of the state vector is independent, Gaussian, and of unit variance and the observations are of each state component separately with independent, Gaussian errors, simulations indicate that the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the state dimension. In this example, the particle filter requires at least 1011 members when applied to a 200-dimensional state. Asymptotic results, following the work of Bengtsson, Bickel, and collaborators, are provided for two cases: one in which each prior state component is independent and identically distributed, and one in which both the prior pdf and the observation errors are Gaussian. The asymptotic theory reveals that, in both cases, the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the variance of the observation log likelihood rather than with the state dimension per se.",

		"abstract": "The radio occultation (RO) technique, which makes use of radio signals transmitted by the global positioning system (GPS) satellites, has emerged as a powerful and relatively inexpensive approach for sounding the global atmosphere with high precision, accuracy, and vertical resolution in all weather and over both land and ocean. On 15 April 2006, the joint Taiwan-U.S. Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC)/Formosa Satellite Mission 3 (COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3, hereafter COSMIC) mission, a constellation of six microsatellites, was launched into a 512-km orbit. After launch the satellites were gradually deployed to their final orbits at 800 km, a process that took about 17 months. During the early weeks of the deployment, the satellites were spaced closely, offering a unique opportunity to verify the high precision of RO measurements. As of September 2007, COSMIC is providing about 2000 RO soundings per day to support the research and operational communities. COSMIC RO data are of better quality than those from the previous missions and penetrate much farther down into the troposphere; 70%–90% of the soundings reach to within 1 km of the surface on a global basis. The data are having a positive impact on operational global weather forecast models. With the ability to penetrate deep into the lower troposphere using an advanced open-loop tracking technique, the COSMIC RO instruments can observe the structure of the tropical atmospheric boundary layer. The value of RO for climate monitoring and research is demonstrated by the precise and consistent observations between different instruments, platforms, and missions. COSMIC observations are capable of intercalibrating microwave measurements from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on different satellites. Finally, unique and useful observations of the ionosphere are being obtained using the RO receiver and two other instruments on the COSMIC satellites, the tiny ionosphere photometer (TIP) and the tri-band beacon.",

A set of three-dimensional orthogonal normal modes is applied to four analysis datasets from July 2007. The datasets are the operational analysis systems of NCEP and ECMWF, the NCEP–NCAR reanalyses, and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed–Community Atmospheric Model (DART–CAM), an ensemble analysis system developed at NCAR. The differences between the datasets can be considered as a measure of uncertainty of the IG contribution to the global energetics. The results show that the percentage of IG motion in the present NCEP, ECMWF, and DART–CAM analysis systems is between 1% and 2% of the total energy field. In the wave part of the flow (zonal wavenumber k ≠ 0), the IG energy contribution is between 9% and 15%. On the contrary, the NCEP–NCAR reanalyses contain more IG motion, especially in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Each analysis contains more energy in the eastward IG motion than in its westward counterpart. The difference is about 2%–3% of the total wave energy and it is associated with the motions projected onto the Kelvin wave in the tropics. The selected truncation parameters of the expansion (zonal, meridional, and vertical truncation) ensure that the projection provides the optimal fit to the input data on model levels. This approach is different from previous applications of the normal modes and under the linearity assumption it allows the application of the inverse projection to obtain details of circulation associated with a selected type of motion. The bulk of the IG motion is confined to the tropics. For the successful reproduction of three-dimensional circulations by the normal modes it is important that the expansion includes a number of vertical modes.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This paper analyzes the spectra and spatiotemporal features of the large-scale inertia-gravity (IG) circulations in four analysis systems in the tropics. Of special interest is the Kelvin wave (KW), which represents between 7% and 25% of the total IG wave (zonal wavenumber k ≠ 0) energy. The mixed Rossby–gravity (MRG) mode comprises between 4% and 15% of the IG wave energy. At the longest scales, the KW spectra are fitted by a law while the MRG energy spectrum appears flat. At shorter scales both modes follow a −3 law. Energy spectra of the total IG wave motion at long zonal scales (zonal wavenumber smaller than 7) have slopes close to −1. The average circulation associated with KW is characterized by reverse flows in the upper and lower troposphere consistent with the ideas behind simple tropical models. The inverse projection is used to quantify the role of Kelvin and MRG waves in current analysis systems in the upper troposphere over the Indian Ocean. At these levels, easterlies between 10°S and 30°N are represented by the KW to a significant degree while the cross-equatorial flow toward the descending branch of the Hadley cell at 10°S is associated with the MRG waves. The transient structure of equatorial waves is presented in the space of normal modes defined by the zonal wavenumbers, meridional Hough functions, and the vertical eigenfunctions. The difference in the depth of the model domain in DART–CAM and NCEP–NCAR on one hand and ECMWF and NCEP on the other appears to be one reason for different wave propagation properties. In the latter case the vertical energy propagation is diagnosed by filtering the propagating KW modes back to physical space. The results agree with the linear theory of vertically propagating equatorial waves.",

		"abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) can be interpreted in the more general context of linear regression theory. The recursive filter equations are equivalent to the normal equations for a weighted least-squares estimate that minimizes a quadratic functional. Solving the normal equations is numerically unreliable and subject to large errors when the problem is ill-conditioned. A numerically reliable and efficient algorithm is presented, based on the minimization of an alternative functional. The method relies on orthogonal rotations, is highly parallel and does not ‘square’ matrices in order to compute the analysis update. Computation of eigenvalue and singular-value decompositions is not required. The algorithm is formulated to process observations serially or in batches and therefore easily handles spatially correlated observation errors. Numerical results are presented for existing algorithms with a hierarchy of models characterized by chaotic dynamics. Under a range of conditions, which may include model error and sampling error, the new algorithm achieves the same or lower mean square errors as the serial Potter and ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) algorithms.

		"abstract": "We demonstrate the feasibility of using observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) studies to help define quantitative trace gas measurement requirements for satellite missions and to evaluate the expected performance of proposed observing strategies. The 2007 U.S. National Research Council Decadal Survey calls for a geostationary (GEO) satellite mission for atmospheric composition and air quality applications (Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events Mission (GEO-CAPE)). The requirement includes a multispectral (near-infrared and thermal infrared) measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) at high spatiotemporal resolution with information on lowermost troposphere concentration. We present an OSSE to assess the improvement in surface CO characterization that would result from the addition of a GEO-CAPE CO measurement to current low Earth orbit (LEO) thermal infrared-only measurements. We construct instrument simulators for these two measurement scenarios and study the case of July 2004 when wildfires in Alaska and Canada led to significant CO pollution over the contiguous United States. Compared to a control experiment, an ensemble-based data assimilation of simulated satellite observations in a global model leads to improvements in both the surface CO distributions and the time evolution of CO profiles at locations affected by wildfire plumes and by urban emissions. In all cases, an experiment with the GEO-CAPE CO measurement scenario (overall model skill of 0.84) performed considerably better than the experiment with the current LEO/thermal infrared measurement (skill of 0.58) and the control (skill of 0.07). This demonstrates the advantages of increased sampling from GEO and enhanced measurement sensitivity to the lowermost troposphere with a multispectral retrieval.",

As in , the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is employed as a simplified cloud model at 2-km horizontal grid spacing. Various observation-space and state-space verification metrics, computed both for ensemble means and individual ensemble members, are employed to assess the quality of ensemble forecasts comparatively across cases. While the cases exhibit noticeable differences in predictability, the forecast skill in each case, as measured by various metrics, decays on a time scale of tens of minutes. The ensemble spread also increases rapidly but significant outlier members or clustering among members are not encountered. Forecast quality is seen to be influenced to varying degrees by the respective initial soundings. While radar data assimilation is able to partially mitigate some of the negative effects in some situations, the supercell case, in particular, remains difficult to predict even after 60 min of data assimilation.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The effectiveness of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for assimilating radar observations at convective scales is investigated for cases whose behaviors span supercellular, linear, and multicellular organization. The parallel EnKF algorithm of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is used for data assimilation, while the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is employed as a simplified cloud model at 2-km horizontal grid spacing. In each case, reflectivity and radial velocity measurements are utilized from a single Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) within the U.S. operational network. Observations are assimilated every 2 min for a duration of 60 min and correction of folded radial velocities occurs within the EnKF. Initial ensemble uncertainty includes random perturbations to the horizontal wind components of the initial environmental sounding. The EnKF performs effectively and with robust results across all the cases. Over the first 18–30 min of assimilation, the rms and domain-averaged prior fits to observations in each case improve significantly from their initial levels, reaching comparable values of 3–6 m s−1 and 7–10 dBZ. Representation of mesoscale uncertainty, albeit in the simplest form of initial sounding perturbations, is a critical part of the assimilation system, as it increases ensemble spread and improves filter performance. In addition, assimilation of “no precipitation” observations (i.e., reflectivity observations with values small enough to indicate the absence of precipitation) serves to suppress spurious convection in ensemble members. At the same time, it is clear that the assimilation is far from optimal, as the ensemble spread is consistently smaller than what would be expected from the innovation statistics and the assumed observation-error variance.",

		"abstract": "Ensemble filters are used in many data assimilation applications in geophysics. Basic implementations of ensemble filters are trivial but are susceptible to errors from many sources. Model error, sampling error and fundamental inconsistencies between the filter assumptions and reality combine to produce assimilations that are suboptimal or suffer from filter divergence. Several auxiliary algorithms have been developed to help filters tolerate these errors. For instance, covariance inflation combats the tendency of ensembles to have insufficient variance by increasing the variance during the assimilation. The amount of inflation is usually determined by trial and error. It is possible, however, to design Bayesian algorithms that determine the inflation adaptively. A spatially and temporally varying adaptive inflation algorithm is described. A normally distributed inflation random variable is associated with each element of the model state vector. Adaptive inflation is demonstrated in two low-order model experiments. In the first, the dominant error source is small ensemble sampling error. In the second, the model error is dominant. The adaptive inflation assimilations have better mean and variance estimates than other inflation methods.",

		"abstract": "This paper applies the normal-mode functions for the three-dimensional diagnosis of systematic analysis increments in the operational systems of ECMWF and NCEP, in the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses and in the ensemble data assimilation system DART/CAM which is developed at NCAR. Non-zero systematic increments are interpreted as the analysis system bias. The main region of tropospheric biases in all systems is the Tropics; most of the large-scale tropical bias resides in the unbalanced (inertio-gravity) motion with the eastward-propagating component being dominant in some datasets. The magnitudes of tropospheric wind-field biases in July 2007 were in the range between 1 ms−1 and 2 ms−1, illustrating the importance of diagnosing analysis systems in the Tropics where magnitudes of the large-scale variability are of the same order. The systematic increments integrated over the whole models' atmosphere appear predominantly balanced; this balance is associated with biases in the zonally averaged balanced state and, in case of ECMWF and NCEP, with the biases at the model top levels. Spectra of analysis increments averaged over one month show that, on average, 20% to 45% of total energy in increment fields belongs to the inertio-gravity motions.

		"abstract": "Abstract Recent results showed the ability of surface-observation assimilation with a single-column model (SCM) and an ensemble filter (EF) to skillfully estimate the vertical structure of the PBL when only climatological information is provided for initialization and forcing. The present study quantifies the relative benefits of model complexity, compared to surface-observation assimilation, for making 30-min SCM ensemble predictions (nowcasts). The SCM is initialized and forced by timely mesoscale forecasts, making it capable of providing flow-dependent probabilistic very short-range forecasts of PBL profiles wherever surface observations are available. Factor separation (FS) analysis measures the relative contributions to skill from EF surface assimilation compared to selected SCM components: parameterized radiation and objectively scaled horizontal advection. Here, the SCM–EF system is presented and its deterministic skill (as represented by ensemble-mean error) is analyzed with FS. Results show that surface assimilation can more meaningfully contribute to the skill levels of temperature, wind, and mixing-ratio nowcasts than model enhancements under a wide range of flow scenarios. However, in the convective PBL regime surface assimilation can enhance the moist bias often observed in parameterized PBL mixing ratio profiles due to poor covariances estimated from the ensemble. Then, the SCM–EF proves useful in revealing a model deficiency. Externally imposed horizontal advection is required to provide skillful ensemble-mean forecasts when not assimilating surface observations, but can offset the benefit realized from assimilation by quickly sweeping the updated state out of the domain. The radiation scheme has a minor effect on forecast performance. It improves the nowcast surface temperature at night, and can act synergistically with assimilation to improve low-level jet predictions, but the effect above the surface steeply decreases with height. The results suggest that an SCM–EF may be helpful in wind-power and pollutant dispersion applications.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) combined with the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF; hereafter WRF) on a 36-km Atlantic basin domain is cycled over six different time periods that include the 10 tropical cyclones (TCs) selected for the NOAA High-Resolution Hurricane (HRH) test. The analysis ensemble is generated every 6 h by assimilating conventional in situ observations, synoptic dropsondes, and TC advisory position and minimum sea level pressure (SLP) data. On average, observation assimilation leads to smaller TC position errors in the analysis compared to the 6-h forecast; however, the same is true for TC minimum SLP only for tropical depressions and storms. Over the 69 HRH initialization times, TC track forecasts from a single member of the WRF EnKF ensemble has 12 h less skill compared to other operational models; the increased track error partially results from the WRF EnKF analysis having a stronger Atlantic subtropical ridge. For nonmajor TCs, the WRF EnKF forecast has lower TC minimum SLP and maximum wind speed errors compared to some operational models, particularly the GFDL model, while category-3, -4, and -5 TCs are characterized by large biases due to horizontal resolution. WRF forecasts initialized from an EnKF analysis have similar or smaller TC track, intensity, and 34-kt wind radii errors relative to those initialized from two other operational analyses, which suggests that EnKF assimilation produces the best TC forecasts for this domain. Both TC track and intensity forecasts are deficient in ensemble variance, which is at least partially due to the lack of error growth in dynamical fields and model biases.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) coupled to the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to generate ensemble analyses and forecasts of a strong African easterly wave (AEW) during the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis field campaign. Ensemble sensitivity analysis is then used to evaluate the impacts of initial condition errors on AEW amplitude and position forecasts at two different initialization times. WRF forecasts initialized at 0000 UTC 8 September 2006, prior to the amplification of the AEW, are characterized by large variability in evolution as compared to forecasts initialized 48 h later when the AEW is within a denser observation network. Short-lead-time amplitude forecasts are most sensitive to the midtropospheric meridional winds, while at longer lead times, midtropospheric θe errors have equal or larger impacts. For AEW longitude forecasts, the largest sensitivities are associated with the θe downstream of the AEW and, to a lesser extent, the meridional winds. Ensemble predictions of how initial condition errors impact the AEW amplitude and position compare qualitatively well with perturbed integrations of the WRF model. Much of the precipitation associated with the AEW is generated by the Kain–Fritsch cumulus parameterization, thus the initial-condition sensitivities are also computed for ensemble forecasts that employ the Betts–Miller–Janjić and Grell cumulus parameterization schemes, and for a high-resolution nested domain with explicit convection, but with the same initial conditions. While the 12-h AEW amplitude forecast is characterized by consistent initial-condition sensitivity among the different schemes, there is greater variability among methods beyond 24 h. In contrast, the AEW longitude forecast is sensitive to the downstream thermodynamic profile with all cumulus schemes.",

The case study tracked the evolution of a large extratropical cyclone and associated cloud features across the central United States during 4–5 June 2005. Overall, the assimilation results revealed that the infrared brightness temperatures had a large positive impact on the simulated cloud field with the best results achieved when both clear-sky and cloudy sky observations were assimilated. The infrared brightness temperatures substantially reduced the bias and root mean square error in the cloud top pressure, cloud water path, 6.95 and 11.2 μm brightness temperatures, and vertical profiles of cloud condensate. Inspection of the thermodynamic variable statistics showed that the assimilation of conventional surface and upper-air observations produced more accurate temperature and wind analyses. When both cloud-affected and thermodynamic variables are considered, however, the best analysis was achieved when conventional observations and clear-sky and cloudy sky 8.5 μm brightness temperatures were assimilated simultaneously.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The representation of tropical cyclone track, intensity, and structure in a set of 69 parallel forecasts performed at each of two horizontal grid increments with the Advanced Research Hurricane (AHW) component of the Weather and Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is evaluated. These forecasts covered 10 Atlantic tropical cyclones: 6 from the 2005 season and 4 from 2007. The forecasts were integrated from identical initial conditions produced by a cycling ensemble Kalman filter. The high-resolution forecasts used moving, storm-centered nests of 4- and 1.33-km grid spacing. The coarse-resolution forecasts consisted of a single 12-km domain (which was identical to the outer domain in the forecasts with nests). Forecasts were evaluated out to 120 h. Novel verification techniques were developed to evaluate forecasts of wind radii and the degree of storm asymmetry. Intensity (maximum wind) and rapid intensification, as well as wind radii, were all predicted more accurately with increased horizontal resolution. These results were deemed to be statistically significant based on the application of bootstrap confidence intervals. No statistically significant differences emerged regarding storm position errors between the two forecasts. Coarse-resolution forecasts tended to overpredict the extent of winds compared to high-resolution forecasts. The asymmetry of gale-force winds was better predicted in the coarser-resolution simulation, but asymmetry of hurricane-force winds was predicted better at high resolution. The skill of the wind radii forecasts decayed gradually over 120 h, suggesting a synoptic-scale control of the predictability of outer winds.",

The approach uses: (1) the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry to simulate the evolution of BC and CO within an ensemble of model simulations; (2) satellite CO retrievals from the MOPITT/Terra instrument to assimilate observed CO into these simulations; (3) the derived sensitivity of BC to CO within these simulations to correct the simulated BC distributions. We demonstrate the performance of this approach through model experiments with and without the BC corrections during the period coinciding with the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-B). Our results show significant improvements (∼50%) in median BC profiles using constraints from MOPITT, based on comparisons with INTEX-B measurements. We find that assimilating MOPITT CO provides considerable impact on simulated BC concentrations, especially over source regions.

		"abstract": "Abstract A deterministic square root ensemble Kalman filter and a stochastic perturbed observation ensemble Kalman filter are used for data assimilation in both linear and nonlinear single variable dynamical systems. For the linear system, the deterministic filter is simply a method for computing the Kalman filter and is optimal while the stochastic filter has suboptimal performance due to sampling error. For the nonlinear system, the deterministic filter has increasing error as ensemble size increases because all ensemble members but one become tightly clustered. In this case, the stochastic filter performs better for sufficiently large ensembles. A new method for computing ensemble increments in observation space is proposed that does not suffer from the pathological behavior of the deterministic filter while avoiding much of the sampling error of the stochastic filter. This filter uses the order statistics of the prior observation space ensemble to create an approximate continuous prior probability distribution in a fashion analogous to the use of rank histograms for ensemble forecast evaluation. This rank histogram filter can represent non-Gaussian observation space priors and posteriors and is shown to be competitive with existing filters for problems as large as global numerical weather prediction. The ability to represent non-Gaussian distributions is useful for a variety of applications such as convective-scale assimilation and assimilation of bounded quantities such as relative humidity.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the degree to which short-term forecasts with global models might be improved if clouds were fully included in a data assimilation system, so that observations of clouds affected all parts of the model state and cloud variables were adjusted during assimilation. The question is examined using a single ensemble data assimilation system coupled to two present-generation climate models with different treatments of clouds. “Perfect-model” experiments using synthetic observations, taken from a free run of the model used in subsequent assimilations, are used to circumvent complications associated with systematic model errors and observational challenges; these provide a rough upper bound on the utility of cloud observations with these models. A series of experiments is performed in which direct observations of the model’s cloud variables are added to the suite of observations being assimilated. In both models, observations of clouds reduce the 6-h forecast error, with much greater reductions in one model than in the other. Improvements are largest in regions where other observations are sparse. The two cloud schemes differ in their complexity and number of degrees of freedom; the model using the simpler scheme makes better use of the cloud observations because of the stronger correlations between cloud-related and dynamical variables (particularly temperature). This implies that the impact of real cloud observations will depend on both the strength of the instantaneous, linear relationships between clouds and other fields in the natural world, and how well each assimilating model’s cloud scheme represents those relationships.",

		"abstract": "Two new filtering/diffusion operators have been implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model finite-volume dynamical core (CAM-FV). First, a fourth-order divergence damping operator has been added to optionally replace the second-order version that has traditionally been used. This provides more scale selective dissipation of divergent modes that can generate grid-scale noise in CAM-FV if not damped properly. For example, data assimilation runs using CAM-FV DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) have revealed potential noise problems at the grid scale that can be alleviated significantly using higher-order divergence damping. Second, a ‘Laplacian’-type damping operator has been implemented to increase the explicit momentum dissipation in the top-of-atmosphere sponge layers. This helps control the excessive polar night jets that have been observed in ultra-high-resolution CAM-FV simulations. Results from stand-alone CAM-FV and CAM-FV DART are presented in this paper along with details on the implementation of the new operators.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This study documents and evaluates the boundary layer and energy budget response to record low 2007 sea ice extents in the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) using 1-day observationally constrained forecasts and 10-yr runs with a freely evolving atmosphere. While near-surface temperature and humidity are minimally affected by sea ice loss in July 2007 forecasts, near-surface stability decreases and atmospheric humidity increases aloft over newly open water in September 2007 forecasts. Ubiquitous low cloud increases over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean are found in both the July 2007 and the September 2007 forecasts. In response to the 2007 sea ice loss, net surface [top of the atmosphere (TOA)] energy budgets change by +19.4 W m−2 (+21.0 W m−2) and −17.9 W m−2 (+1.4 W m−2) in the July 2007 and September 2007 forecasts, respectively. While many aspects of the forecasted response to sea ice loss are consistent with physical expectations and available observations, CAM4’s ubiquitous July 2007 cloud increases over newly open water are not. The unrealistic cloud response results from the global application of parameterization designed to diagnose stratus clouds based on lower-tropospheric stability (CLDST). In the Arctic, the well-mixed boundary layer assumption implicit in CLDST is violated. Requiring a well-mixed boundary layer to diagnose stratus clouds improves the CAM4 cloud response to sea ice loss and increases July 2007 surface (TOA) energy budgets over newly open water by +11 W m−2 (+14.9 W m−2). Of importance to high-latitude climate feedbacks, unrealistic stratus cloud compensation for sea ice loss occurs only when stable and dry atmospheric conditions exist. Therefore, coupled climate projections that use CAM4 will underpredict Arctic sea ice loss only when dry and stable summer conditions occur.",

The case study tracks the evolution of several extratropical weather systems that occurred across the contiguous United States during 7–8 January 2008. Overall, the results indicate that assimilating 8.5-μm brightness temperatures improves the cloud analysis and forecast accuracy, but has the tendency to degrade the water vapor mixing ratio and thermodynamic fields unless a small localization radius is used. Vertical cross sections showed that varying the localization radius had a minimal impact on the shape of the analysis increments; however, their magnitude consistently increased with increasing localization radius. By the end of the assimilation period, the moisture, temperature, cloud, and wind errors generally decreased with decreasing localization radius and became similar to the Control case in which only conventional observations were assimilated if the shortest localization radius was used. Short-range ensemble forecasts showed that the large positive impact of the infrared observations on the final cloud analysis diminished rapidly during the forecast period, which indicates that it is difficult to maintain beneficial changes to the cloud analysis if the moisture and thermodynamic forcing controlling the cloud evolution are not simultaneously improved. These results show that although assimilation of infrared observations consistently improves the cloud field regardless of the length of the localization radius, it may be necessary to use a smaller radius to also improve the accuracy of the moisture and thermodynamic fields.",

		"abstract": "We describe a global atmospheric data assimilation scheme that has been adapted for use with a Martian General Circulation Model (GCM), with the ultimate goal of creating globally and temporally interpolated “reanalysis” data sets from planetary atmospheric observations. The system uses the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) software to apply an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to the MarsWRF GCM. Specific application to Mars also required the development of a radiance forward model for near-nadir Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) observations. Preliminary results from an assimilation of 40 sols of TES radiance data, taken around Ls = 150° (August 1999, Mars Year 24), are provided. 1.3 million TES observations are ingested and used to improve the state prediction by the GCM, with bias and error reductions obtained throughout the state vector. Results from the assimilation suggest steepening of the latitudinal and vertical thermal gradients with concurrent strengthening of the mid-latitude zonal jets, and a slower recession of the southern polar ice edge than predicted by the unaided GCM. Limitations of the prescribed dust model are highlighted by the presence of an atmospheric radiance bias. Preliminary results suggest the prescribed dust vertical profile might not be suitable for all seasons, in accordance with more recent observations of the vertical distribution of dust by the Mars Climate Sounder. The tools developed using this DA system are available at http://www.marsclimatecenter.com. A tutorial and example TES radiance assimilation are also provided.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This paper quantifies the linear mass–wind field balance and its temporal variability in the global data assimilation system Data Assimilation Research Testbed/Community Atmosphere Model (DART/CAM), which is based on the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. The part of the model state that projects onto quasigeostrophic modes represents the balanced state. The unbalanced part corresponds to inertio-gravity (IG) motions. The 80-member ensemble is diagnosed by using the normal-mode function expansion. It was found that the balanced variance in the prior ensemble is on average about 90% of the total variance and about 80% of the wave variance. Balance depends on the scale and the largest zonal scales are best balanced. For zonal wavenumbers greater than k = 30 the balanced variance stays at about the 45% level. There is more variance in the westward- than in the eastward-propagating IG modes; the difference is about 2% of the total wave variance and it is associated with the covariance inflation. The applied inflation field has a major impact on the structure of the prior variance field and its reduction by the assimilation step. The shape of the inflation field mimics the global radiosonde observation network (k = 2), which is associated with the minimum variance reduction in k = 2. Temporal variability of the ensemble variance is significant and appears to be associated with changes in the energy of the flow. A perfect-model assimilation experiment supports the findings from the real-observation experiment.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we present our recent research development in the area of ionospheric specification by means of data assimilation of ground-based observations. NOAA's Total Electron Content specification methodology (namely, a Gauss-Markov Kalmanfilter with an empirical model of the ionosphere as a background model) over the continental United States has lately been expanded to the multiregional domains and to the entire globe. Analyses of the global TEC maps reveal clear signatures of thermosphere-ionosphere coupling, in both dynamical and compositional nature, even though the underlying specification methodology does not take thermospheric effects into account. This suggests that ground-based observations of electron density contain some information about the state of the thermosphere. By using a thermosphere ionosphere general circulation model in a prototype Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), we examine the role of thermosphere-ionosphere coupling in a global ionospheric specification. Observing system simulation experiments, designed for a global network of ionosondes, suggest that ionospheric data assimilation considerably benefits from self-consistent treatment of thermosphere-ionosphere coupling in a forecast model as well as in assimilation schemes, both of which can be achieved inherently by using the EnKF.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A central issue for understanding past climates involves the use of sparse time-integrated data to recover the physical properties of the coupled climate system. This issue is explored in a simple model of the midlatitude climate system that has attributes consistent with the observed climate. A quasigeostrophic (QG) model thermally coupled to a slab ocean is used to approximate midlatitude coupled variability, and a variant of the ensemble Kalman filter is used to assimilate time-averaged observations. The dependence of reconstruction skill on coupling and thermal inertia is explored. Results from this model are compared with those for an even simpler two-variable linear stochastic model of midlatitude air–sea interaction, for which the assimilation problem can be solved semianalytically. Results for the QG model show that skill decreases as the length of time over which observations are averaged increases in both the atmosphere and ocean when normalized against the time-averaged climatological variance. Skill in the ocean increases with slab depth, as expected from thermal inertia arguments, but skill in the atmosphere decreases. An explanation of this counterintuitive result derives from an analytical expression for the forecast error covariance in the two-variable stochastic model, which shows that the ratio of noise to total error increases with slab ocean depth. Essentially, noise becomes trapped in the atmosphere by a thermally stiffer ocean, which dominates the decrease in initial condition error owing to improved skill in the ocean. Increasing coupling strength in the QG model yields higher skill in the atmosphere and lower skill in the ocean, as the atmosphere accesses the longer ocean memory and the ocean accesses more atmospheric high-frequency “noise.” The two-variable stochastic model fails to capture this effect, showing decreasing skill in both the atmosphere and ocean for increased coupling strength, due to an increase in the ratio of noise to the forecast error variance. Implications for the potential for data assimilation to improve climate reconstructions are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Two parallel experiments were designed to evaluate whether assimilating microwave radiances with a cyclic, limited-area ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) could improve track, intensity, and precipitation forecasts of Typhoon Morakot (2009). The experiments were configured identically, except that one assimilated microwave radiances and the other did not. Both experiments produced EAKF analyses every 6 h between 1800 UTC 3 August and 1200 UTC 9 August 2009, and the mean analyses initialized 72-h Weather Research and Forecasting model forecasts. Examination of individual forecasts and average error statistics revealed that assimilating microwave radiances ultimately resulted in better intensity forecasts compared to when radiances were withheld. However, radiance assimilation did not substantially impact track forecasts, and the impact on precipitation forecasts was mixed. Overall, net positive results suggest that assimilating microwave radiances with a limited-area EAKF system is beneficial for tropical cyclone prediction, but additional studies are needed.",

Analysis/forecast cycling experiments with and without AMSU-A radiance assimilation were performed over the Atlantic Ocean for the period 11 August–13 September 2008, when five named storms formed. For convenience, the radiance forward operators and bias-correction coefficients, along with the majority of quality-control decisions, were computed by a separate, preexisting variational assimilation system. The bias-correction coefficients were obtained from 3-month offline statistics and fixed during the EnKF analysis cycles. The vertical location of each radiance observation, which is required for covariance localization in the EnKF, was taken to be the level at which the AMSU-A channels’ weighting functions peaked. Deterministic 72-h WRF forecasts initialized from the ensemble-mean analyses were evaluated with a focus on TC prediction. Assimilating AMSU-A radiances produced better depictions of the environmental fields when compared to reanalyses and dropwindsonde observations. Radiance assimilation also resulted in substantial improvement of TC track and intensity forecasts with track-error reduction up to 16% for forecasts beyond 36 h. Additionally, assimilating both radiances and satellite winds gave markedly more benefit for TC track forecasts than solely assimilating radiances.",

		"abstract": "A hybrid nudging-ensemble Kalman filter (HNEnKF), previously tested in the Lorenz three-variable model and a two-dimensional shallow-water model, is now explored in WRF/DART with real observations using a Cross Appalachian Tracer Experiment case from September 1983 (CAPTEX-83). The HNEnKF, effectively combining observation nudging and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), achieves a more gradual data assimilation and greatly reduces the insertion noise compared to the EnKF. Three-hourly surface observations and 12-hourly rawinsonde observations from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) are assimilated. These assimilated meteorological observations are used to verify the priors of the experiments. It is found that the HNEnKF generally obtains better priors than the EnKF. To independently verify the HNEnKF approach, the hourly WRF experiment results are also used to drive the Second-Order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF) model to predict surface tracer concentrations that are verified against the observed surface concentration data. The HNEnKF analyses driving SCIPUFF produce better statistics of the independent tracer data than the EnKF. Thus there appear to be some advantages in the hourly dynamic analyses produced by the continuous HNEnKF compared to the intermittent EnKF. The analyses of surface pressure tendency demonstrate that the HNEnKF is able to provide better temporal smoothness and dynamic consistency in the hourly analyses than the EnKF.

The F3/C electron density profiles (EDPs) uniformly distributed around the globe which provide an excellent opportunity to monitor the ionospheric electron density structure. The NCAR TIE-GCM simulates the Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere by using self-consistent solutions for the coupled nonlinear equations of hydrodynamics, neutral and ion chemistry, and electrodynamics. The F3/C EDP are combined with the TIE-GCM simulations by EnKF algorithms implemented in the NCAR Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) open-source community facility to compute the expected value of electron density, which is ‘the best’ estimate of the current ionospheric state. Assimilation analyses obtained with real F3/C electron density profiles are compared with independent ground-based observations as well as the F3/C profiles themselves. The comparison shows the improvement of the primary ionospheric parameters, such as NmF2 and hmF2. Nevertheless, some unrealistic signatures appearing in the results and high rejection rates of observations due to the applied outlier threshold and quality control are found in the assimilation experiments. This paper further discusses the limitations of the model and the impact of ensemble member creation approaches on the assimilation results, and proposes possible methods to avoid these problems for future work.",

		"abstract": "We estimate here a flux-transport dynamo model's response time to changes in meridional flow speed. Time variation in meridional flow primarily determines the shape of a cycle in this class of dynamo models. In order to simultaneously predict the shape, amplitude, and timing of a solar cycle by implementing an ensemble Kalman filter in the framework of Data Assimilation Research Testbed, it is important to know the model's sensitivity to flow variation. Guided by observations, we consider a smooth increase or decrease in meridional flow speed for a specified time (a few months to a few years), after which the flow speed comes back to the steady speed, and implement that time-varying meridional flow at different phases of solar cycle. We find that the model's response time to change in flow speed peaks at four to six months if the flow change lasts for one year. The longer the changed flow lasts, the longer the model takes to respond. Magnetic diffusivity has no influence in the model's response to flow variation as long as the dynamo operates in the advection-dominated regime. Experiments with more complex flow variations indicate that the shape and amplitude of flow perturbation have no influence in the estimate of the model's response time.",

This provides a large set of data assimilation tools for climate model research and development. Aspects of the interface to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) software are discussed and a variety of applications are illustrated, ranging from model development to the production of long series of analyses. CAM output is compared directly to real observations from platforms ranging from radiosondes to global positioning system satellites. Such comparisons use the temporally and spatially heterogeneous analysis error estimates available from the ensemble to provide very specific forecast quality evaluations. The ability to start forecasts from analyses, which were generated by CAM on its native grid and have no foreign model bias, contributed to the detection of a code error involving Arctic sea ice and cloud cover. The potential of parameter estimation is discussed. A CAM ensemble reanalysis has been generated for more than 15 yr. Atmospheric forcings from the reanalysis were required as input to generate an ocean ensemble reanalysis that provided initial conditions for decadal prediction experiments. The software enables rapid experimentation with differing sets of observations and state variables, and the comparison of different models against identical real observations, as illustrated by a comparison of forecasts initialized by interpolated ECMWF analyses and by DART/CAM analyses.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) “hybrid” variational-ensemble data assimilation (DA) algorithm was used to initialize WRF model forecasts of three tropical cyclones (TCs). The hybrid-initialized forecasts were compared to forecasts initialized by WRF's three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) DA system. An ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) updated a 32-member WRF-based ensemble system that provided flow-dependent background error covariances for the hybrid. The 3DVAR, hybrid, and EAKF configurations cycled continuously for ~3.5 weeks and produced new analyses every 6 h that initialized 72-h WRF forecasts with 45-km horizontal grid spacing. Additionally, the impact of employing a TC relocation technique and using multiple outer loops (OLs) in the 3DVAR and hybrid minimizations were explored. Model output was compared to conventional, dropwindsonde, and TC “best track” observations. On average, the hybrid produced superior forecasts compared to 3DVAR when only one OL was used during minimization. However, when three OLs were employed, 3DVAR forecasts were dramatically improved but the mean hybrid performance changed little. Additionally, incorporation of TC relocation within the cycling systems further improved the mean 3DVAR-initialized forecasts but the average hybrid-initialized forecasts were nearly unchanged.",

In this study the authors evaluate the mesoscale assimilation system and the convection-permitting forecasts, at 15- and 3-km grid spacing, respectively. Experiments employing different physics options within the continuously cycled ensemble data assimilation system are shown to lead to differences in the mean mesoscale analysis characteristics. Convection-permitting forecasts with a fixed model configuration are initialized from these physics-varied analyses, as well as control runs from 0.5° Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis. Systematic bias in the analysis background influences the analysis fit to observations, and when this analysis initializes convection-permitting forecasts, the forecast skill is degraded as bias in the analysis background increases. Moreover, differences in mean error characteristics associated with each physical parameterization suite lead to unique errors of spatial, temporal, and intensity aspects of convection-permitting rainfall forecasts. Observation bias by platform type is also shown to impact the analysis quality.",

		"abstract": "Wind power is rapidly gaining prominence as a major source of renewable energy. Harnessing this promising energy source is challenging because of the chaotic nature of wind and its inherently intermittent nature. Accurate forecasting tools are critical to support the integration of wind energy into power grids and to maximize its impact on renewable energy portfolios. We have adapted the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), a community software facility which includes the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm, to expand our capability to use observational data to improve forecasts produced with a fully coupled hydrologic and atmospheric modeling system, the ParFlow (PF) hydrologic model and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric model, coupled via mass and energy fluxes across the land surface, and resulting in the PF.WRF model. Numerous studies have shown that soil moisture distribution and land surface vegetative processes profoundly influence atmospheric boundary layer development and weather processes on local and regional scales. We have used the PF.WRF model to explore the connections between the land surface and the atmosphere in terms of land surface energy flux partitioning and coupled variable fields including hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture, and wind speed and demonstrated that reductions in uncertainty in these coupled fields realized through assimilation of soil moisture observations propagate through the hydrologic and atmospheric system. The sensitivities found in this study will enable further studies to optimize observation strategies to maximize the utility of the PF.WRF-DART forecasting system.",

		"abstract": "This paper proposes a differential inflation scheme and applies this technique to driver estimation for the Global Ionosphere–Thermosphere Model (GITM) using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is a part of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). Driver estimation using EAKF is first demonstrated on a linear example and then applied to GITM. The Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) neutral mass density measurements are assimilated into a biased version of GITM, and the solar flux index, F10.7, is estimated. Although the estimate of F10.7 obtained using DART does not converge to the measured values, the converged values are shown to drive the GITM output close to CHAMP measurements. In order to prevent the ensemble spread from converging to zero, the state and driver estimates are inflated. In particular, the F10.7 estimate is inflated to have a constant variance. It is shown that EAKF with differential inflation reduces the model bias from 73% down to 7% along the CHAMP satellite path when compared to the biased GITM output obtained without using data assimilation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) density measurements are used to validate the data assimilation performance at locations different from measurement locations. It is shown that the bias at GRACE locations is decreased from 76% down to 52% as compared to not using data assimilation, showing that model estimation of the thermosphere is improved globally.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A probabilistic verification and factor-separation analysis (FSA) elucidate skillful nowcasts of planetary boundary layer (PBL) temperature, moisture, and wind profiles with a single-column model (SCM) and ensemble filter (EF) assimilation of surface observations. Recently, an FSA showed the importance of surface assimilation versus advection and radiation on ensemble-mean skill. That work addressed the necessary complexity of the model and assimilation scheme for improving PBL nowcasts, relative to deterministic-mesoscale predictions. Here, probabilistic ensemble-based SCM forecasts are compared to a simple probabilistic postprocessing scheme termed climatological dressing (CD). CD adjusts a deterministic mesoscale forecast using surface-atmosphere 3D-climatological covariances, a 30-min persistence model, and surface-forecast errors. It also dresses the adjusted profile with an in-sample uncertainty distribution (obtained from archives) scaled by the 30-min forecast error. Superior deterministic skill from SCM/EF results during night when flow-dependent covariances are more accurate than climatological covariances. CD is deterministically more skillful for temperature and moisture profiles during daytime because SCM/PBL parameterization yields biased covariances. SCM/EF is most probabilistically skillful because (a) the EF covariances accommodate large seasonal variability, (b) the 30-min error persistence assumption fails during nighttime, and (c) vertical error covariance estimates from archived forecasts are generally poor estimates of actual error covariances. A probabilistic FSA of the SCM/EF shows the relative importance of surface assimilation, radiation parameterization, and advection during night. Results confirm surface assimilation as the most important factor. A factor can be deterministically beneficial and probabilistically detrimental, or vice versa, depending on its role in reducing mean error or improving sharpness. Assimilation results in notable probabilistic improvement for nowcasts of low-level jet structures.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Experiments with the single-column implementation of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model provide a basis for deducing land–atmosphere coupling errors in the model. Coupling occurs both through heat and moisture fluxes through the land–atmosphere interface and roughness sublayer, and turbulent heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes through the atmospheric surface layer. This work primarily addresses the turbulent fluxes, which are parameterized following the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory applied to the atmospheric surface layer. By combining ensemble data assimilation and parameter estimation, the model error can be characterized. Ensemble data assimilation of 2-m temperature and water vapor mixing ratio, and 10-m wind components, forces the model to follow observations during a month-long simulation for a column over the well-instrumented Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Central Facility near Lamont, Oklahoma. One-hour errors in predicted observations are systematically small but nonzero, and the systematic errors measure bias as a function of local time of day. Analysis increments for state elements nearby (15 m AGL) can be too small or have the wrong sign, indicating systematically biased covariances and model error. Experiments using the ensemble filter to objectively estimate a parameter controlling the thermal land–atmosphere coupling show that the parameter adapts to offset the model errors, but that the errors cannot be eliminated. Results suggest either structural errors or further parametric errors that may be difficult to estimate. Experiments omitting atypical observations such as soil and flux measurements lead to qualitatively similar deductions, showing the potential for assimilating common in situ observations as an inexpensive framework for deducing and isolating model errors.",

		"abstract": "To improve snowpack estimates in Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover fraction (SCF) was assimilated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) via the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The interface between CLM4 and DART is a flexible, extensible approach to land surface data assimilation. This data assimilation system has a large ensemble (80-member) atmospheric forcing that facilitates ensemble-based land data assimilation. We use 40 randomly chosen forcing members to drive 40 CLM members as a compromise between computational cost and the data assimilation performance. The localization distance, a parameter in DART, was tuned to optimize the data assimilation performance at the global scale. Snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth are adjusted via the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, particularly in regions with large SCF variability. The root-mean-square error of the forecast SCF against MODIS SCF is largely reduced. In DJF (December-January-February), the discrepancy between MODIS and CLM4 is broadly ameliorated in the lower-middle latitudes (23°–45°N). Only minimal modifications are made in the higher-middle (45°–66°N) and high latitudes, part of which is due to the agreement between model and observation when snow cover is nearly 100%. In some regions it also reveals that CLM4-modeled snow cover lacks heterogeneous features compared to MODIS. In MAM (March-April-May), adjustments to snow move poleward mainly due to the northward movement of the snowline (i.e., where largest SCF uncertainty is and SCF assimilation has the greatest impact). The effectiveness of data assimilation also varies with vegetation types, with mixed performance over forest regions and consistently good performance over grass, which can partly be explained by the linearity of the relationship between SCF and SWE in the model ensembles. The updated snow depth was compared to the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) data. Differences between CMC and CLM4 are generally reduced in densely monitored regions.",

The ability to assimilate lower atmosphere observations of aircraft and radiosonde temperature and winds, satellite drift winds, and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate refractivity along with middle/upper atmosphere temperature observations from SABER and Aura MLS is demonstrated. The WACCM+DART data assimilation system is shown to be able to reproduce the salient features, and variability, of the troposphere present in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Re-Analysis. In the mesosphere, the fit of WACCM+DART to observations is found to be slightly worse when only lower atmosphere observations are assimilated compared to a control experiment that is reflective of the model climatological variability. This differs from previous results which found that assimilation of lower atmosphere observations improves the fit to mesospheric observations. This discrepancy is attributed to the fact that due to the gravity wave drag parameterizations, the model climatology differs significantly from the observations in the mesosphere, and this is not corrected by the assimilation of lower atmosphere observations. The fit of WACCM+DART to mesospheric observations is, however, significantly improved compared to the control experiment when middle/upper atmosphere observations are assimilated. We find that assimilating SABER observations reduces the root-mean-square error and bias of WACCM+DART relative to the independent Aura MLS observations by ∼50%, demonstrating that assimilation of middle/upper atmosphere observations is essential for accurate specification of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region in WACCM+DART. Last, we demonstrate that WACCM+DART is able to follow the dynamical and chemical variability during the 2009 sudden stratosphere warming, illustrating the capability of WACCM+DART to generate high-quality atmospheric reanalysis from the surface to the lower thermosphere.",

The mesoscale cycling experiment for the continuous ensemble data assimilation was verified against independent surface mesonet observations and demonstrated the positive impact on short-range forecasts over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) domain throughout the month-long period of June 2008. The EnKF assimilation of surface observations was found useful for systematically improving the simulation of the depth and the structure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the reduction of surface bias errors. These benefits were extended above PBL and resulted in a better precipitation forecast for up to 12 h. With the careful specification of observation errors, not only the reliability of the ensemble system but also the quality of the following forecast was improved, especially in moisture. In this retrospective case study of a squall line, assimilation of surface observations produced analysis increments consistent with the structure and dynamics of the boundary layer. As a result, it enhanced the horizontal gradient of temperature and moisture across the frontal system to provide a favorable condition for the convective initiation and the following heavy rainfall prediction in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Even with the assimilation of upper-level observations, the analysis without the assimilation of surface observations simulated a surface cold front that was much weaker and slower than observed.",

However, no consensus has been reached yet about the Sun's meridional circulation pattern observations and theories. By implementing an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation in a Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model using Data Assimilation Research Testbed framework, we find that the best reconstruction of time variation in meridional flow speed can be obtained when 10 or more observations are used with an updating time of 15 days and a ≤10% observational error. Increasing ensemble size from 16 to 160 improves reconstruction. Comparison of reconstructed flow speed with “true state” reveals that EnKF data assimilation is very powerful for reconstructing meridional flow speeds and suggests that it can be implemented for reconstructing spatiotemporal patterns of meridional circulation.",

An empirical localization function (ELF) is used to effectively spread the information from PS in the vertical. The ELF minimizes the root-mean-square difference between the truth and the posterior ensemble mean for state variables. The temporal frequency of the observations is increased from 6 to 3 h, and then 1 h. By observing only PS, the uncertainty throughout the entire depth of the troposphere can be constrained. The analysis error over the entire depth of the troposphere, especially the middle troposphere, is reduced with increased assimilation frequency. The ELF is similar to the vertical localization function used in the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR); thus, it demonstrates that the current vertical localization in the 20CR is close to the optimal localization function.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The influence of assimilating enhanced atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) on mesoscale analyses and forecasts of tropical cyclones (TC) is investigated. AMVs from the geostationary Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) are processed by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS, University of Wisconsin–Madison) for the duration of Typhoon Sinlaku (2008), which included a rapid intensification phase and a slow, meandering track. The ensemble Kalman filter and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model are utilized within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed. In addition to conventional observations, three different groups of AMVs are assimilated in parallel experiments: CTL, the same dataset assimilated in the NCEP operational analysis; CIMSS(h), hourly datasets processed by CIMSS; and CIMSS(h+RS), the dataset including AMVs from the rapid-scan mode. With an order of magnitude more AMV data assimilated, the CIMSS(h) analyses exhibit a superior track, intensity, and structure to CTL analyses. The corresponding 3-day ensemble forecasts initialized with CIMSS(h) yield smaller track and intensity errors than those initialized with CTL. During the period when rapid-scan AMVs are available, the CIMSS(h+RS) analyses offer additional modifications to the TC and its environment. In contrast to many members in the ensemble forecasts initialized from the CTL and CIMSS(h) analyses that predict an erroneous landfall in China, the CIMSS(h+RS) members capture recurvature, albeit prematurely. The results demonstrate the promise of assimilating enhanced AMV data into regional TC models. Further studies to identify optimal strategies for assimilating integrated full-resolution multivariate data from satellites are under way.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The role of upstream subsynoptic forecast errors on forecasts of two different central Oklahoma severe convection events (19 and 31 May 2013) characterized by strong synoptic forcing during the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX) are evaluated by applying the ensemble-based sensitivity technique to WRF ensemble forecasts with explicit convection. During both cases, the forecast of the timing and intensity of convection over central Oklahoma is modulated by the southward extent of upstream midtropospheric potential vorticity anomalies that are moving through the base of a larger-scale upstream trough but pass by central Oklahoma prior to convective initiation. In addition, the convection forecasts are also sensitive to the position of lower-tropospheric boundaries, such that moving the boundaries in a manner that would lead to increased equivalent potential temperature over central Oklahoma prior to convective initiation leads to more precipitation. Statistical PV inversion and correlation calculations suggest that the midtropospheric PV and near-surface boundary sensitivities are not independent; the winds associated with the PV error can modulate the position of the lower-tropospheric boundary through advection in a manner consistent with the implied sensitivity. As a consequence, it appears that reducing the uncertainty in specific upstream subsynoptic features prior to convective initiation could improve subsequent forecasts of severe convection.",

The EPS is particularly unique in that continuously cycling, limited-area, mesoscale ensemble Kalman filter analyses provide diverse initial conditions. In addition to describing the EPS configurations, initial forecast assessments are presented that suggest the EPS can provide valuable severe weather guidance and skillful predictions of precipitation. The EPS output is available to operational forecasters, many of whom have incorporated the products into their toolboxes. Given such rapid embrace of an experimental system by the operational community, acceleration of convection-allowing EPS development is encouraged.",

		"abstract": "Abstract For ensemble-based data assimilation, localization is used to limit the impact of observations on physically distant state variables to reduce spurious error correlations caused by limited ensemble size. Traditionally, the localization value applied is spatially homogeneous. Yet there are potentially larger errors and different covariance length scales in precipitation systems, and that may justify the use of different localization functions for precipitating and nonprecipitating regions. Here this is examined using empirical localization functions (ELFs). Using output from an ensemble observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), ELFs provide estimates of horizontal and vertical localization for different observation types in regions with and without precipitation. For temperature and u- and υ-wind observations, the ELFs for precipitating regions are shown to have smaller horizontal localization scales than for nonprecipitating regions. However, the ELFs for precipitating regions generally have larger vertical localization scales than for nonprecipitating regions. The ELFs are smoothed and then applied in three additional OSSEs. Spatially homogeneous ELFs are found to improve performance relative to a commonly used localization function with compact support. When different ELFs are applied in precipitating and nonprecipitating regions, performance is further improved, but varying ELFs by observation type was not found to be as important. Imbalance in initial states caused by use of different localization functions is diagnosed by the domain-averaged surface pressure tendency. Forecasts from analyses with ELFs have smaller surface pressure tendencies than the standard localization, indicating improved initial balance with ELFs.",

		"abstract": "Abstract In this study, the authors examine initiation of severe convection along a daytime surface dryline in a 10-member ensemble of convection-permitting simulations. Results indicate that the minimum buoyancy Bmin of PBL air parcels must be small (Bmin > −0.5°C) for successful deep convection initiation (CI) to occur along the dryline. Comparing different ensemble members reveals that CAPE magnitudes (allowing for entrainment) and the width of the zone of negligible Bmin extending eastward from the dryline act together to influence CI. Since PBL updrafts that initiate along the dryline move rapidly northeast in the vertically sheared flow as they grow into the free troposphere, a wider zone of negligible Bmin helps ensure adequate time for incipient storms to mature, which, itself, is hastened by larger CAPE. Local Bmin budget calculations and trajectory analysis are used to quantify physical processes responsible for the reduction of negative buoyancy prior to CI. Here, the grid-resolved forcing and forcing from temperature and moisture tendencies in the PBL scheme (arising from surface fluxes) contribute about equally in ensemble composites. However, greater spatial variability in grid-resolved forcing focuses the location of the greatest net forcing along the dryline. The grid-resolved forcing is influenced by a thermally direct vertical circulation, where time-averaged ascent at the east edge of the dryline results in locally deeper moisture and cooler conditions near the PBL top. Horizontal temperature advection spreads the cooler air eastward above higher equivalent potential temperature air at source levels of convecting air parcels, resulting in a wider zone of negligible Bmin that facilitates sustained CI.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Mesoscale forecasts are strongly influenced by physical processes that are either poorly resolved or must be parameterized in numerical models. In part because of errors in these parameterizations, mesoscale ensemble data assimilation systems generally suffer from underdispersiveness, which can limit the quality of analyses. Two explicit representations of model error for mesoscale ensemble data assimilation are explored: a multiphysics ensemble in which each member’s forecast is based on a distinct suite of physical parameterization, and stochastic kinetic energy backscatter in which small noise terms are included in the forecast model equations. These two model error techniques are compared with a baseline experiment that includes spatially and temporally adaptive covariance inflation, in a domain over the continental United States using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for mesoscale ensemble forecasts and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) for the ensemble Kalman filter. Verification against independent observations and Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) 13-km analyses for the month of June 2008 showed that including the model error representation improved not only the analysis ensemble, but also short-range forecasts initialized from these analyses. Explicitly accounting for model uncertainty led to a better-tuned ensemble spread, a more skillful ensemble mean, and higher probabilistic scores, as well as significantly reducing the need for inflation. In particular, the stochastic backscatter scheme consistently outperformed both the multiphysics approach and the control run with adaptive inflation over almost all levels of the atmosphere both deterministically and probabilistically.",

HWRF is a complex multicomponent system, consisting of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model coupled to the Princeton Ocean Model for Tropical Cyclones (POM-TC), a sophisticated initialization package including a data assimilation system and a set of postprocessing and vortex tracking tools. HWRF’s development is centralized at the Environmental Modeling Center of NOAA’s National Weather Service, but it incorporates contributions from a variety of scientists spread out over several governmental laboratories and academic institutions. This distributed development scenario poses significant challenges: a large number of scientists need to learn how to use the model, operational and research codes need to stay synchronized to avoid divergence, and promising new capabilities need to be tested for operational consideration. This article describes how the Developmental Testbed Center has engaged in the HWRF developmental cycle in the last three years and the services it provides to the community in using and developing HWRF.",

The different capabilities of MOPITT and IASI retrievals are highlighted, with particular attention to instrument vertical sensitivity and coverage and how these impact the analyses. MOPITT and IASI CO retrievals mostly constrain the CO fields close to the main anthropogenic, biogenic, and biomass burning CO sources. In the case of IASI CO assimilation, we also observe constraints on CO far from the sources. During the simulation time period (June and July 2008), CO assimilation of both instruments strongly improves the atmospheric CO state as compared to independent observations, with the higher spatial coverage of IASI providing better results on the global scale. However, the enhanced sensitivity of multispectral MOPITT observations to near surface CO over the main source regions provides synergistic effects at regional scales.",

		"abstract": "Abstract High-resolution Doppler radar velocities and in situ surface observations collected in a tornadic supercell on 5 June 2009 during the second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) are assimilated into a simulated convective storm using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). A series of EnKF experiments using a 1-km horizontal model grid spacing demonstrates the sensitivity of the cold pool and kinematic structure of the storm to the assimilation of these observations and to different model microphysics parameterizations. An experiment is performed using a finer grid spacing (500 m) and the most optimal data assimilation and model configurations from the sensitivity tests to produce a realistically evolving storm. Analyses from this experiment are verified against dual-Doppler and in situ observations and are evaluated for their potential to confidently evaluate mesocyclone-scale processes in the storm using trajectory analysis and calculations of Lagrangian vorticity budgets. In Part II of this study, these analyses will be further evaluated to learn the roles that mesocyclone-scale processes play in tornado formation, maintenance, and decay. The coldness of the simulated low-level outflow is generally insensitive to the choice of certain microphysical parameterizations, likely owing to the vast quantity of kinematic and in situ thermodynamic observations assimilated. The three-dimensional EnKF wind fields and parcel trajectories resemble those retrieved from dual-Doppler observations within the storm, suggesting that realistic four-dimensional mesocyclone-scale processes are captured. However, potential errors are found in trajectories and Lagrangian three-dimensional vorticity budget calculations performed within the mesocyclone that may be due to the coarse (2 min) temporal resolution of the analyses. Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting trajectories in this area of the storm.",

		"abstract": "An ensemble-based forecast and data assimilation system has been developed for use in Navy aerosol forecasting. The system makes use of an ensemble of the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (ENAAPS) at 1 × 1°, combined with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter from NCAR's Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The base ENAAPS-DART system discussed in this work utilizes the Navy Operational Global Analysis Prediction System (NOGAPS) meteorological ensemble to drive offline NAAPS simulations coupled with the DART ensemble Kalman filter architecture to assimilate bias-corrected MODIS aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals. This work outlines the optimization of the 20-member ensemble system, including consideration of meteorology and source-perturbed ensemble members as well as covariance inflation. Additional tests with 80 meteorological and source members were also performed. An important finding of this work is that an adaptive covariance inflation method, which has not been previously tested for aerosol applications, was found to perform better than a temporally and spatially constant covariance inflation. Problems were identified with the constant inflation in regions with limited observational coverage. The second major finding of this work is that combined meteorology and aerosol source ensembles are superior to either in isolation and that both are necessary to produce a robust system with sufficient spread in the ensemble members as well as realistic correlation fields for spreading observational information. The inclusion of aerosol source ensembles improves correlation fields for large aerosol source regions, such as smoke and dust in Africa, by statistically separating freshly emitted from transported aerosol species. However, the source ensembles have limited efficacy during long-range transport. Conversely, the meteorological ensemble generates sufficient spread at the synoptic scale to enable observational impact through the ensemble data assimilation. The optimized ensemble system was compared to the Navy's current operational aerosol forecasting system, which makes use of NAVDAS-AOD (NRL Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System for aerosol optical depth), a 2-D variational data assimilation system. Overall, the two systems had statistically insignificant differences in root-mean-squared error (RMSE), bias, and correlation relative to AERONET-observed AOT. However, the ensemble system is able to better capture sharp gradients in aerosol features compared to the 2DVar system, which has a tendency to smooth out aerosol events. Such skill is not easily observable in bulk metrics. Further, the ENAAPS-DART system will allow for new avenues of model development, such as more efficient lidar and surface station assimilation as well as adaptive source functions. At this early stage of development, the parity with the current variational system is encouraging.",

		"abstract": "Ionospheric storms can have important effects on radio communications and navigation systems. Storm time ionospheric predictions have the potential to form part of effective mitigation strategies to these problems. Ionospheric storms are caused by strong forcing from the solar wind. Electron density enhancements are driven by penetration electric fields, as well as by thermosphere-ionosphere behavior including Traveling Atmospheric Disturbances and Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and changes to the neutral composition. This study assesses the effect on 1 h predictions of specifying initial ionospheric and thermospheric conditions using total electron content (TEC) observations under a fixed set of solar and high-latitude drivers. Prediction performance is assessed against TEC observations, incoherent scatter radar, and in situ electron density observations. Corotated TEC data provide a benchmark of forecast accuracy. The primary case study is the storm of 10 September 2005, while the anomalous storm of 21 January 2005 provides a secondary comparison. The study uses an ensemble Kalman filter constructed with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. Maps of preprocessed, verticalized GPS TEC are assimilated, while high-latitude specifications from the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics and solar flux observations from the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment are used to drive the model. The filter adjusts ionospheric and thermospheric parameters, making use of time-evolving covariance estimates. The approach is effective in correcting model biases but does not capture all the behavior of the storms. In particular, a ridge-like enhancement over the continental USA is not predicted, indicating the importance of predicting storm time electric field behavior to the problem of ionospheric forecasting.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A nondeveloping tropical disturbance, identified as TCS025, was observed during three intensive observing periods during The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Pacific Asian Regional Campaign (T-PARC)/Tropical Cyclone Structure-2008 (TCS-08) field experiment. The low-level circulation of the disturbance was relatively weak, asymmetric, and displaced a considerable distance from the midlevel circulation. An ensemble of high-resolution numerical simulations initialized from global model analyses was used to further examine TCS025. These simulations tended to unrealistically overdevelop the TCS025 disturbance. This study extends that work by examining the impact of assimilating in situ observations of TCS025 and dual-Doppler radial velocities from the airborne Electra Doppler Radar (ELDORA) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble data assimilation system. The assimilation of observations results in a more accurate vortex structure that is consistent with the observational analysis. In addition, forecasts initialized from the state of the ensemble after data assimilation exhibit less development than both the control simulation and an ensemble of forecasts without prior data assimilation. A composite analysis of developing and nondeveloping forecasts from the ensemble reveals that convection was more active in developing simulations, especially near the low-level circulation center. This led to larger diabatic heating rates, spinup of the low-level circulation from vorticity stretching, and greater alignment of the low- and midlevel vorticity centers. In contrast, nondeveloping simulations exhibited less convection, and the circulation was more heavily impacted by vertical wind shear.",

		"abstract": "We implement an Ensemble Kalman Filter procedure using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed for assimilating “synthetic” meridional flow-speed data in a Babcock–Leighton-type flux-transport solar dynamo model. By performing several “observing system simulation experiments,” we reconstruct time variation in meridional flow speed and analyze sensitivity and robustness of reconstruction. Using 192 ensemble members including 10 observations, each with 4% error, we find that flow speed is reconstructed best if observations of near-surface poloidal fields from low latitudes and tachocline toroidal fields from midlatitudes are assimilated. If observations include a mixture of poloidal and toroidal fields from different latitude locations, reconstruction is reasonably good for error in low-latitude data, even if observational error in polar region data becomes 200%, but deteriorates when observational error increases in low- and midlatitude data. Solar polar region observations are known to contain larger errors than those in low latitudes; our forward operator (a flux-transport dynamo model here) can sustain larger errors in polar region data, but is more sensitive to errors in low-latitude data. An optimal reconstruction is obtained if an assimilation interval of 15 days is used; 10- and 20-day assimilation intervals also give reasonably good results. Assimilation intervals days do not produce faithful reconstructions of flow speed, because the system requires a minimum time to develop dynamics to respond to flow variations. Reconstruction also deteriorates if an assimilation interval days is used, because the system’s inherent memory interferes with its short-term dynamics during a substantially long run without updating.",

		"abstract": "This paper introduces the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with chemistry/Data Assimilation Research Testbed (WRF-Chem/DART) chemical transport forecasting/data assimilation system together with the assimilation of compact phase space retrievals of satellite-derived atmospheric composition products. WRF-Chem is a state-of-the-art chemical transport model. DART is a flexible software environment for researching ensemble data assimilation with different assimilation and forecast model options. DART's primary assimilation tool is the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. WRF-Chem/DART is applied to the assimilation of Terra/Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) carbon monoxide (CO) trace gas retrieval profiles. Those CO observations are first assimilated as quasi-optimal retrievals (QORs). Our results show that assimilation of the CO retrievals (i) reduced WRF-Chem's CO bias in retrieval and state space, and (ii) improved the CO forecast skill by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and increasing the Coefficient of Determination (R2). Those CO forecast improvements were significant at the 95 % level.\n\n Trace gas retrieval data sets contain (i) large amounts of data with limited information content per observation, (ii) error covariance cross-correlations, and (iii) contributions from the retrieval prior profile that should be removed before assimilation. Those characteristics present challenges to the assimilation of retrievals. This paper addresses those challenges by introducing the assimilation of compact phase space retrievals (CPSRs). CPSRs are obtained by preprocessing retrieval data sets with an algorithm that (i) compresses the retrieval data, (ii) diagonalizes the error covariance, and (iii) removes the retrieval prior profile contribution. Most modern ensemble assimilation algorithms can efficiently assimilate CPSRs. Our results show that assimilation of MOPITT CO CPSRs reduced the number of observations (and assimilation computation costs) by ∼ 35 %, while providing CO forecast improvements comparable to or better than with the assimilation of MOPITT CO QORs.",

		"abstract": "Ensemble Kalman Filter in the framework of Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) has been successfully implemented into a 2D kinematic flux-transport dynamo model by Dikpati and colleagues in order to do a parameter estimation, the parameter being the meridional flow-speed as function of time. They performed several ‘Observing System Simulation Experiments’ (OSSEs), and showed that an optimal reconstruction of time-series of meridional flow-speed can be obtained by using 16 ensemble members and only one surface magnetic observation with 30% observational error. Error in reconstruction can be reduced by increasing the ensemble size and number of observations. However, this parameter reconstruction has been found to be sensitive to locations from where observational data are taken. While assimilation of low-latitudes’ surface poloidal magnetic field data can produce good reconstruction, medium-frequency oscillations appear in time-series of reconstructed flow-speed if tachocline toroidal field data are assimilated. These oscillations occur primarily because tachocline toroidal fields change very little during an assimilation interval taken to be 15days, due to changes in meridional flow. A Babcock-Leighton dynamo model’s response time to changes in meridional flow-speed is a few months. We show here that rms error in reconstruction can be significantly reduced if model’s response time is taken into consideration in assimilation of tachocline toroidal field data.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Very few frameworks exist that estimate global-scale soil moisture through microwave land data assimilation (DA). Toward this goal, such a framework has been developed by linking the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4), and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within DART is utilized to estimate global multilayer soil moisture by assimilating brightness temperature observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). A 40-member ensemble of Community Atmosphere Model, version 4.0 (CAM4.0), reanalysis is adopted to drive CLM4 simulations. Space-specific, time-invariant microwave parameters are precalibrated to minimize uncertainties in RTM. Besides, various methods are designed to upscale AMSR-E observations for computational efficiency and time shift CAM4.0 forcing to facilitate global daily assimilations. A series of experiments are conducted to quantify the DA sensitivity to microwave parameters, choice of assimilated observations, and different CLM4 updating schemes. Evaluation results indicate that the newly established CLM4–RTM–DART framework improves the open-loop CLM4-simulated soil moisture. Precalibrated microwave parameters, rather than their default values, can ensure a more robust global-scale performance. In addition, updating near-surface soil moisture is capable of improving soil moisture in deeper layers (0–30 cm), while simultaneously updating multilayer soil moisture fails to obtain intended improvements. Future work is needed to address the systematic bias in CLM4 that cannot be fully covered through the ensemble spread in CAM4.0 reanalysis.",

		"abstract": "The intraseasonal variability of the eastward propagating nonmigrating diurnal tide with zonal wave number 3 (DE3) during 2007 in the mesosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere is investigated using a whole atmosphere model reanalysis and satellite observations. The atmospheric reanalysis is based on implementation of data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. The tidal variability in the WACCM+DART reanalysis is compared to the observed variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) observations, in the ionosphere based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations, and in the upper thermosphere (∼475 km) based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density observations. To obtain the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT and upper thermosphere, we apply the method of tidal deconvolution to the TIMED/SABER observations and consider the difference in the ascending and descending longitudinal wave number 4 structure in the GRACE observations. The results reveal that tidal amplitude changes of 5–10 K regularly occur on short timescales (∼10–20 days) in the MLT. Similar variability occurs in the WACCM+DART reanalysis and TIMED/SABER observations, demonstrating that the short-term variability can be captured in whole atmosphere models that employ data assimilation and in observations by the technique of tidal deconvolution. The impact of the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT on the ionosphere and thermosphere is also clearly evident in the COSMIC and GRACE observations. Analysis of the troposphere forcing in WACCM+DART and simulations of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) show that the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT is not related to a single source; rather, it is due to a combination of changes in troposphere forcing, zonal mean atmosphere, and wave-wave interactions.",

		"abstract": "The ensemble data assimilation version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model + Data Assimilation Research Testbed developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research is utilized to study the quasi-2 day wave (QTDW) activities during boreal summer period of 2007. The westward wave number 3 (W3) and 4 (W4) modes intermittently dominated the QTDW oscillations at different times. The W3 peaked 4 times from day 172 to day 224 with the major peak at around days 199–206 being much stronger than the others. The W4 also showed a quadruple structure during the whole summer period but with their amplitudes comparable with each other. The period of W4 increases from 42 h on day 186 (with stronger easterly jet) to 56 h on day 225 (with weaker easterly jet), while the W3 period is more stable with the maximum perturbation occurring at 52 h. Thus, the W3 exhibits more normal mode features than W4. Further diagnostic analysis shows that the barotropically/baroclinically unstable regions at middle and low latitudes are more effective for the amplification of W3 with stronger instabilities providing larger forcing. Moreover, the temporal variability of the refractive indexes and critical layers of W4, which are related to the background wind, are responsible for its period variations. We also find that the absence of a westward wave number 2 (W2) QTDW during boreal summer of 2007 is due to the weaker easterly jet compared with that during austral summer.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Safety compliance issues for operational studies of the atmosphere with balloons require quantifying risks associated with descent and developing strategies to reduce the uncertainties at the location of the touchdown point. Trajectory forecasts are typically computed from weather forecasts produced by an operational center, for example, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. This study uses past experiments to investigate strategies for improving these forecasts. Trajectories for open stratospheric balloon (OSB) short-term flights are computed using mesoscale simulations with the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) Model initialized with ECMWF operational forecasts and are assimilated with radio soundings using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter, for three case studies during the Strapolété 2009 campaign in Sweden. The results are very variable: in one case, the error in the final simulated position is reduced by 90% relative to the forecast using the ECMWF winds, while in another case the forecast is hardly improved. Nonetheless, they reveal the main source of forecasting error: during the ceiling phase, errors due to unresolved inertia–gravity waves accumulate as the balloon continuously experiences one phase of a wave for a few hours, whereas they essentially average out during the ascent and descent phases, when the balloon rapidly samples through whole wave packets. This sensitivity to wind during the ceiling phase raises issues regarding the feasibility of such forecasts and the observations that would be needed. The ensemble spread is also analyzed, and it is noted that the initial ensemble perturbations should probably be improved in the future for better forecasts.",

		"abstract": "We examine in detail a 1 year global reanalysis of carbon monoxide (CO) that is based on joint assimilation of conventional meteorological observations and Measurement of Pollution in The Troposphere (MOPITT) multispectral CO retrievals in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Our focus is to assess the impact to the chemical system when CO distribution is constrained in a coupled full chemistry-climate model like CESM. To do this, we first evaluate the joint reanalysis (MOPITT Reanalysis) against four sets of independent observations and compare its performance against a reanalysis with no MOPITT assimilation (Control Run). We then investigate the CO burden and chemical response with the aid of tagged sectoral CO tracers. We estimate the total tropospheric CO burden in 2002 (from ensemble mean and spread) to be 371 ± 12% Tg for MOPITT Reanalysis and 291 ± 9% Tg for Control Run. Our multispecies analysis of this difference suggests that (a) direct emissions of CO and hydrocarbons are too low in the inventory used in this study and (b) chemical oxidation, transport, and deposition processes are not accurately and consistently represented in the model. Increases in CO led to net reduction of OH and subsequent longer lifetime of CH4 (Control Run: 8.7 years versus MOPITT Reanalysis: 9.3 years). Yet at the same time, this increase led to 5–10% enhancement of Northern Hemisphere O3 and overall photochemical activity via HOx recycling. Such nonlinear effects further complicate the attribution to uncertainties in direct emissions alone. This has implications to chemistry-climate modeling and inversion studies of longer-lived species.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Two cases of dryline convection initiation (CI) over north Texas have been simulated (3 April 2012 and 15 May 2013) from a 50-member WRF-DART ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) ensemble. In this study, ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) is applied to a convective forecast metric, maximum composite reflectivity (referred to as the response function), as a simple proxy for CI to analyze dynamic mesoscale sensitivities at the surface and aloft. Analysis reveals positional and magnitude sensitivities related to the strength and placement of important dynamic features. Convection initiation is sensitive to the evolving temperature and dewpoint fields upstream of the forecast response region in the near-CI time frame (0–12 h), prior to initiation. The sensitivity to thermodynamics is also manifest in the magnitude of dewpoint gradients along the dryline that triggers the convection. ESA additionally highlights the importance of antecedent precipitation and cold pool generation that modifies the pre-CI environment. Aloft, sensitivity of CI to a weak short-wave trough and capping inversion-level temperature is coherent, consistent, and traceable through the entire forecast period. Notwithstanding the (often) non-Gaussian distribution of ensemble member forecasts of convection, which violate the underpinnings of ESA theory, ESA is demonstrated to sufficiently identify regions that influence dryline CI. These results indicate an application of ESA for severe storm forecasting at operational centers and forecast offices as well as other mesoscale forecasting applications.",

The forecasts were generated using a convection-permitting model ensemble, and supercell occurrence was diagnosed via updraft helicity and low-level vertical vorticity. Forecasts of four severe convective weather events were considered. Probability fields were computed from the model data, and forecast skill was quantified using rotation track data, storm report data, and a neighborhood-based verification approach. The ability to adjust the rotation track threshold for verification purposes was shown to be an advantage of the rotation track data over the storms reports, because the reports are inherently binary observations whereas the rotation tracks are based on values of Doppler velocity shear. These results encourage further pursuit of incorporating observed rotation track data in the forecasting and verification of severe weather events.",

This case was characterized by two distinct modes of convection located 150 km apart in western Nebraska and South Dakota, which formed on either side of an axis of high, lower-tropospheric equivalent potential temperature . Convection forecasts over both regions are found to be sensitive to the position of this axis. The convection in Nebraska is sensitive to the position of the western edge of the axis near an upstream dryline, which modulates the preconvective prior to the diurnal maximum. In contrast, the convection in South Dakota is sensitive to the position of the eastern edge of the axis near a cold front, which also modulates the preconvective in that location. The position of the axis is modulated by the positions of both upstream and downstream mid- to upper-tropospheric potential vorticity anomalies, and can be traced backward in time to the initial conditions. Dropsondes sampling the region prior to convective initiation indicate that ensemble members with better representations of upstream conditions in sensitive regions are associated with better convective forecasts over Nebraska.",

Currently available smartphone pressure observations are tested through assimilation in a mesoscale ensemble for a 3-day, convectively active period in the eastern United States. Both raw pressure (altimeter) observations and 1-h pressure (altimeter) tendency observations are considered. The available observation density closely follows population density, but observations are also available in rural areas. The smartphone observations are found to contain significant noise, which can limit their effectiveness. The assimilated smartphone observations contribute to small improvements in 1-h forecasts of surface pressure and 10-m wind, but produce larger errors in 2-m temperature forecasts. Short-term (0–4 h) precipitation forecasts are improved when smartphone pressure and pressure tendency observations are assimilated as compared with an ensemble that assimilates no observations. However, these improvements are limited to broad, mesoscale features with minimal skill provided at convective scales using the current smartphone observation density. A specific mesoscale convective system (MCS) is examined in detail, and smartphone pressure observations captured the expected dynamic structures associated with this feature. Possibilities for further development of smartphone observations are discussed.",

These unique observations were taken to better understand the upscale effects of deep convection on the environment, and are used to validate the accuracy of convection-allowing (Δx = 3 km) model ensemble analyses. A 36-member ensemble was created with physics diversity using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, and observations were assimilated via the Data Assimilation Research Testbed using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. A 4-day sequence of convective events from 28 to 31 May 2013 in the south-central United States was analyzed by assimilating Doppler radar and conventional observations. No MPEX upsonde observations were assimilated. Since the ensemble mean analyses produce an accurate depiction of the storms, the MPEX observations are used to verify the accuracy of the analyses of the near-storm environment. A total of 81 upsondes were released over the 4-day period, sampling different regions of near-storm environments including storm inflow, outflow, and anvil. The MPEX observations reveal modest analysis errors overall when considering all samples, although specific environmental regions reveal larger errors in some state fields. The ensemble analyses underestimate cold pool depth, and storm inflow meridional winds have a pronounced northerly bias that results from an underprediction of inflow wind speed magnitude. Most bias distributions are Gaussian-like, with a few being bimodal owing to systematic biases of certain state fields and environmental regions.",

		"abstract": "Abstract It is well known that global numerical model analyses and forecasts benefit from the routine assimilation of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) derived from meteorological satellites. Recent studies have also shown that the assimilation of enhanced (spatial and temporal) AMVs can benefit research-mode regional model forecasts of tropical cyclone track and intensity. In this study, the impact of direct assimilation of enhanced (higher resolution) AMV datasets in the NCEP operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model (HWRF) system is investigated. Forecasts of Atlantic tropical cyclone track and intensity are examined for impact by inclusion of enhanced AMVs via direct data assimilation. Experiments are conducted for AMVs derived using two methodologies (“HERITAGE” and “GOES-R”), and also for varying levels of quality control in order to assess and inform the optimization of the AMV assimilation process. Results are presented for three selected Atlantic tropical cyclone events and compared to Control forecasts without the enhanced AMVs as well as the corresponding operational HWRF forecasts. The findings indicate that the direct assimilation of high-resolution AMVs has an overall modest positive impact on HWRF forecasts, but the impact magnitudes are dependent on the 1) availability of rapid scan imagery used to produce the AMVs, 2) AMV derivation approach, 3) level of quality control employed in the assimilation, and 4) vortex initialization procedure (including the degree to which unbalanced states are allowed to enter the model analyses).",

		"abstract": "Abstract Particle filters (PFs) are Monte Carlo data assimilation techniques that operate with no parametric assumptions for prior and posterior errors. A data assimilation method introduced recently, called the local PF, approximates the PF solution within neighborhoods of observations, thus allowing for its use in high-dimensional systems. The current study explores the potential of the local PF for atmospheric data assimilation through cloud-permitting numerical experiments performed for an idealized squall line. Using only 100 ensemble members, experiments using the local PF to assimilate simulated radar measurements demonstrate that the method provides accurate analyses at a cost comparable to ensemble filters currently used in weather models. Comparisons between the local PF and an ensemble Kalman filter demonstrate benefits of the local PF for producing probabilistic analyses of non-Gaussian variables, such as hydrometeor mixing ratios. The local PF also provides more accurate forecasts than the ensemble Kalman filter, despite yielding higher posterior root-mean-square errors. A major advantage of the local PF comes from its ability to produce more physically consistent posterior members than the ensemble Kalman filter, which leads to fewer spurious model adjustments during forecasts. This manuscript presents the first successful application of the local PF in a weather prediction model and discusses implications for real applications where nonlinear measurement operators and nonlinear model processes limit the effectiveness of current Gaussian data assimilation techniques.",

		"abstract": "We report that assimilating total electron content (TEC) into a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model by using the ensemble Kalman filter results in improved specification and forecast of eastward prereversal enhancement (PRE) electric field (E field). Through data assimilation, the ionospheric plasma density, thermospheric winds, temperature, and compositions are adjusted simultaneously. The improvement of duskside PRE E field calculation over the prior state is achieved primarily by intensification of eastward neutral wind. The improved E field calculation promotes a stronger plasma fountain and deepens the equatorial trough. As a result, the horizontal gradients of Pedersen conductivity and eastward wind are increased due to greater zonal electron density gradient and smaller ion drag at dusk, respectively. Such modifications provide preferable conditions and obtain a strengthened PRE magnitude closer to the observation. The adjustment of PRE E field is enabled through self-consistent thermosphere and ionosphere coupling processes captured in the model. This study suggests that the PRE E field that is critical in driving the evening equatorial plasma instability could be better forecasted by assimilation of TECs in the 10 min cycling.",

		"abstract": "Data assimilation of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) for aerosol forecasting was tested within the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) framework, using variational and ensemble data assimilation methods. Navy aerosol forecasting currently makes use of a deterministic NAAPS simulation coupled to Navy Variational Data Assimilation System for aerosol optical depth, a two-dimensional variational data assimilation system, for MODIS AOT assimilation. An ensemble version of NAAPS (ENAAPS) coupled to an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed was recently developed, allowing for a range of data assimilation and forecasting experiments to be run with deterministic NAAPS and ENAAPS. The main findings are that the EAKF, with its flow-dependent error covariances, makes better use of sparse observations such as AERONET AOT. Assimilating individual AERONET observations in the two-dimensional variational system can increase the analysis errors when observations are located in high AOT gradient regions. By including AERONET with MODIS AOT assimilation, the magnitudes of peak aerosol events (AOT > 1) were better captured with improved temporal variability, especially in India and Asia where aerosol prediction is a challenge. Assimilating AERONET AOT with MODIS had little impact on the 24 h forecast skill compared to MODIS assimilation only, but differences were found downwind of AERONET sites. The 24 h forecast skill was approximately the same for forecasts initialized with analyses from AERONET AOT assimilation alone compared to MODIS assimilation, particularly in regions where the AERONET network is dense; including the United States and Europe, indicating that AERONET could serve as a backup observation network for over-land synoptic-scale aerosol events.",

In this study, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed to investigate the potential of high space- and time-resolution column measurements as constraints on urban NOx emissions. The regional chemistry–meteorology assimilation system where meteorology and chemical variables are simultaneously assimilated is comprised of a chemical transport model, WRF-Chem, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed, and a geostationary observation simulator. We design OSSEs to investigate the sensitivity of emission inversions to the accuracy and uncertainty of the wind analyses and the emission updating scheme. We describe the overall model framework and some initial experiments that point out the first steps toward an optimal configuration for improving our understanding of NOx emissions by combining space-based measurements and data assimilation. Among the findings we describe is the dependence of errors in the estimated NOx emissions on the wind forecast errors, showing that wind vectors with a RMSE below 1 m s−1 allow inference of NOx emissions with a RMSE of less than 30 mol/(km2 × h) at the 3 km scale of the model we use. We demonstrate that our inference of emissions is more accurate when we simultaneously update both NOx emissions and NOx concentrations instead of solely updating emissions. Furthermore, based on our analyses, we recommend carrying out meteorology assimilations to stabilize NO2 transport from the initial wind errors before starting the emission assimilation. We show that wind uncertainties (calculated as a spread around a mean wind) are not important for estimating NOx emissions when the wind uncertainties are reduced below 1.5 m s−1. Finally, we present results assessing the role of separate vs. simultaneous chemical and meteorological assimilation in a model framework without covariance between the meteorology and chemistry.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This study tests the hypothesis that assimilating mid- to upper-tropospheric, meso-α- to synoptic-scale observations collected in upstream, preconvective environments is insufficient to improve short-range ensemble convection initiation (CI) forecast skill over the set of cases considered by the 2013 Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX) because of a limited influence upon the lower-tropospheric phenomena that modulate CI occurrence, timing, and location. The ensemble Kalman filter implementation within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed as coupled to the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is used to initialize two nearly identical 30-member ensembles of short-range forecasts for each case: one initial condition set that incorporates MPEX dropsonde observations and one that excludes these observations. All forecasts for a given mission begin at 1500 UTC and are integrated for 15 h on a convection-permitting grid encompassing much of the conterminous United States. Forecast verification is conducted probabilistically using fractions skill score and deterministically using a 2 × 2 contingency table approach at multiple neighborhood sizes and spatiotemporal event-matching thresholds to assess forecast skill and support hypothesis testing. The probabilistic verification represents the first of its kind for numerical CI forecasts. Forecasts without MPEX observations have high fractions skill score and probabilities of detection on the meso-α scale but exhibit a considerable high bias for forecast CI event count. Assimilating MPEX observations has a negligible impact upon forecast skill for the cases considered, independent of verification metric, as the MPEX observations result in only subtle differences primarily manifest in the position and intensity of atmospheric features responsible for focusing and/or triggering deep, moist convection.",

In the experiments, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is applied and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature TB observations are assimilated into an RA system composed of the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4); radiative transfer models (RTMs); and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The performance of two snowpack RTMs, the Dense Media Radiative Transfer–Multi-Layers model (DMRT-ML), and the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) in improving snow depth estimates through RA is compared. Continental-scale snow estimates are enhanced through RA by using AMSR-E TB at the 18.7- and 23.8-GHz channels [3% (DMRT-ML) and 2% (MEMLS) improvements compared to the cases using the 18.7- and 36.5-GHz channels] and by considering the vegetation single-scattering albedo ω [2.5% (DMRT-ML) and 4.8% (MEMLS) improvements compared to the cases neglecting ω]. The contribution of TB of the vegetation canopy to TB at the top of the atmosphere is better represented by considering ω in the RA system, and improvements in the resulting snow depth are evident for the forest land-cover type (about 5%–11%) and the taiga and alpine snow classes (about 5%–11% and 4%–8%, respectively), especially in the MEMLS case. Compared to the open-loop run (0.171-m snow depth RMSE), about 7% (DMRT-ML) and 10% (MEMLS) overall improvements of the RA performance are achieved.",

The aliasing ratio of E2 from wave number 3 (W3) in the synoptic WACCM data set is a constant value of 4 × 10−6% due to its uniform sampling pattern, whereas the aliasing is latitudinally dependent if the WACCM fields are sampled asynoptically based on the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) sampling. The aliasing ratio based on SABER sampling is 75% at 40°S during late January, where and when W3 peaks. The analysis of the synoptic WACCM data set shows that the E2 is in fact a winter phenomenon, which peaks in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere at high latitudes. In the austral winter period, the amplitudes of E2 can reach 10 K, 20 m/s, and 30 m/s for temperature, zonal, and meridional winds, respectively. In the boreal winter period, the wave perturbations are only one third as strong as those in austral winter. Diagnostic analysis also shows that the mean flow instabilities in the winter upper mesosphere polar region provide sources for the amplification of E2. This is different from the westward QTDWs, whose amplifications are related to the summer easterly jet. In addition, the E2 also peaks at lower altitude than the westward modes.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A current barrier to greater deployment of offshore wind turbines is the poor quality of numerical weather prediction model wind and turbulence forecasts over open ocean. The bulk of development for atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) parameterization schemes has focused on land, partly because of a scarcity of observations over ocean. The 100-m FINO1 tower in the North Sea is one of the few sources worldwide of atmospheric profile observations from the sea surface to turbine hub height. These observations are crucial to developing a better understanding and modeling of physical processes in the marine ABL. In this study the WRF single-column model (SCM) is coupled with an ensemble Kalman filter from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) to create 100-member ensembles at the FINO1 location. The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which model parameter estimation can improve offshore wind forecasts. Combining two datasets that provide lateral forcing for the SCM and two methods for determining , the time-varying sea surface roughness length, four WRF-SCM/DART experiments are conducted during the October–December 2006 period. The two methods for determining are the default Fairall-adjusted Charnock formulation in WRF and use of the parameter estimation techniques to estimate in DART. Using DART to estimate is found to reduce 1-h forecast errors of wind speed over the Charnock–Fairall ensembles by 4%–22%. However, parameter estimation of does not simultaneously reduce turbulent flux forecast errors, indicating limitations of this approach and the need for new marine ABL parameterizations.",

		"abstract": "Understanding changes in the burden and growth rate of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been the focus of several recent studies but still lacks scientific consensus. Here we investigate the role of decreasing anthropogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emissions since 2002 on hydroxyl radical (OH) sinks and tropospheric CH4 loss. We quantify this impact by contrasting two model simulations for 2002–2013: (1) a Measurement of the Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO reanalysis and (2) a Control-Run without CO assimilation. These simulations are performed with the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry of the Community Earth System Model fully coupled chemistry climate model with prescribed CH4 surface concentrations. The assimilation of MOPITT observations constrains the global CO burden, which significantly decreased over this period by 20%. We find that this decrease results to (a) increase in CO chemical production, (b) higher CH4 oxidation by OH, and (c) 8% shorter CH4 lifetime. We elucidate this coupling by a surrogate mechanism for CO-OH-CH4 that is quantified from the full chemistry simulations.",

		"abstract": "Abstract In this study, the ensemble of three-dimensional variational data assimilation (En3DVar) method for convective-scale weather is adopted and evaluated using an idealized supercell storm simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Synthetic radar radial velocity, reflectivity, satellite-derived cloud water path (CWP), and total precipitable water (TPW) data are produced from the simulated supercell storm and then these data are assimilated into another WRF Model run that starts with no convection. Two types of experiments are performed. The first assimilates radar and satellite CWP data using a perfect storm environment. The second assimilates additional TPW data using a storm environment with dry bias. The first set of experiments indicates that incorporating CWP and radar data into the assimilation leads to a much faster initiation of supercell storms than found using radar data alone. Assimilating CWP data primarily improves the analyses of nonprecipitating hydrometeor variables. The results from the second set of experiments demonstrate the critical importance of the storm environment. When using the biased storm environment, assimilation of CWP and radar data enhances the analyses, but the forecast skill rapidly decreases over the subsequent 1-h forecast. Further experiments show that assimilating the TPW data has a large impact on storm environment that is essential to the accuracy of the storm forecasts. In general, the combination of radar data and satellite data within the En3DVar results in better analyses and forecasts than when only radar data are used, especially for an imperfect storm environment.",

		"abstract": "Abstract One primary goal of annual Spring Forecasting Experiments (SFEs), which are coorganized by NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory and Storm Prediction Center and conducted in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Hazardous Weather Testbed, is documenting performance characteristics of experimental, convection-allowing modeling systems (CAMs). Since 2007, the number of CAMs (including CAM ensembles) examined in the SFEs has increased dramatically, peaking at six different CAM ensembles in 2015. Meanwhile, major advances have been made in creating, importing, processing, verifying, and developing tools for analyzing and visualizing these large and complex datasets. However, progress toward identifying optimal CAM ensemble configurations has been inhibited because the different CAM systems have been independently designed, making it difficult to attribute differences in performance characteristics. Thus, for the 2016 SFE, a much more coordinated effort among many collaborators was made by agreeing on a set of model specifications (e.g., model version, grid spacing, domain size, and physics) so that the simulations contributed by each collaborator could be combined to form one large, carefully designed ensemble known as the Community Leveraged Unified Ensemble (CLUE). The 2016 CLUE was composed of 65 members contributed by five research institutions and represents an unprecedented effort to enable an evidence-driven decision process to help guide NOAA’s operational modeling efforts. Eight unique experiments were designed within the CLUE framework to examine issues directly relevant to the design of NOAA’s future operational CAM-based ensembles. This article will highlight the CLUE design and present results from one of the experiments examining the impact of single versus multicore CAM ensemble configurations.",

		"abstract": "The ability to perform data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended version (WACCMX) is implemented using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results are presented demonstrating that WACCMX+DART analysis fields reproduce the middle and upper atmosphere variability during the 2009 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. Compared to specified dynamics WACCMX, which constrains the meteorology by nudging toward an external reanalysis, the large-scale dynamical variability of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere is improved in WACCMX+DART. This leads to WACCMX+DART better representing the downward transport of chemical species from the mesosphere into the stratosphere following the SSW. WACCMX+DART also reproduces most aspects of the observed variability in ionosphere total electron content and equatorial vertical plasma drift during the SSW. Hindcast experiments initialized on 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 January are used to assess the middle and upper atmosphere predictability in WACCMX+DART. A SSW, along with the associated middle and upper atmosphere variability, is initially predicted in the hindcast initialized on 15 January, which is ∼10 days prior to the warming. However, it is not until the hindcast initialized on 20 January that a major SSW is forecast to occur. The hindcast experiments reveal that dominant features of the total electron content can be forecasted ∼10–20 days in advance. This demonstrates that whole atmosphere models that properly account for variability in lower atmosphere forcing can potentially extend the ionosphere-thermosphere forecast range.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Simulating Arctic sea ice conditions up to the present and predicting them several months in advance has high stakeholder value, yet remains challenging. Advanced data assimilation (DA) methods combine real observations with model forecasts to produce sea ice reanalyses and accurate initial conditions for sea ice prediction. This study introduces a sea ice DA framework for a sea ice model with a parameterization of the ice thickness distribution by resolving multiple thickness categories. Specifically, the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, version 5 (CICE5), is integrated with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). A series of perfect model observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are designed to explore DA algorithms within the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the relative importance of different observation types. This study demonstrates that assimilating sea ice concentration (SIC) observations can effectively remove SIC errors, with the error of total Arctic sea ice area reduced by about 60% annually. When the impact of SIC observations is strongly localized in space, the error of total volume is also modestly improved. The largest simulation improvements are produced when sea ice thickness (SIT) and SIC are jointly assimilated, with the error of total volume decreased by more than 70% annually. Assimilating multiyear sea ice concentration (MYI) can reduce error in total volume by more than 50%. Assimilating MYI produces modest improvements in snow depth (errors are reduced by around 16%), while assimilating SIC and SIT has no obvious influence on snow depth. This study also suggests that different observation types may need different localization distances to optimize DA performance.",

		"abstract": "A fully parallel ensemble data assimilation and forecasting system has been developed for the Red Sea based on the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) to simulate the Red Sea circulation and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble assimilation software. An important limitation of operational ensemble assimilation systems is the risk of ensemble members’ collapse. This could happen in those situations when the filter update step imposes large corrections on one, or more, of the forecasted ensemble members that are not fully consistent with the model physics. Increasing the ensemble size is expected to improve the assimilation system performances, but obviously increases the risk of members’ collapse. Hardware failure or slow numerical convergence encountered for some members should also occur more frequently. In this context, the manual steering of the whole process appears as a real challenge and makes the implementation of the ensemble assimilation procedure uneasy and extremely time consuming. This paper presents our efforts to build an efficient and fault-tolerant MITgcm-DART ensemble assimilation system capable of operationally running thousands of members. Built on top of Decimate, a scheduler extension developed to ease the submission, monitoring and dynamic steering of workflow of dependent jobs in a fault-tolerant environment, we describe the assimilation system implementation and discuss in detail its coupling strategies. Within Decimate, only a few additional lines of Python is needed to define flexible convergence criteria and to implement any necessary actions to the forecast ensemble members, as for instance (i) restarting faulty job in case of job failure, (ii) changing the random seed in case of poor convergence or numerical instability, (iii) adjusting (reducing or increasing) the number of parallel forecasts on the fly, (iv) replacing members on the fly to enrich the ensemble with new members, etc. We demonstrate the efficiency of the system with numerical experiments assimilating real satellites sea surface height and temperature observations in the Red Sea.",

Interactive ecological processes influence land C pools and our understanding of these processes is imperfect so land surface models have errors and biases when compared to each other and to real observations. Here we implement an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), a sequential state data assimilation technique to reduce these errors and biases. We implement the EAKF using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed coupled with the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5 in CESM 1.2). We assimilated simulated and real satellite observations for a site in central New Mexico, United States. A series of observing system simulation experiments allowed assessment of the data assimilation system without model error. This showed that assimilating biomass and leaf area index observations decreased model error in C dynamics forecasts (29% using biomass observations and 40% using leaf area index observations) and that assimilation in combination shows greater improvement (51% using both observation streams). Assimilating real observations highlighted likely model structural errors and we implemented an adaptive model-variance-inflation technique to allow the model to track the observations. Monthly and longer model forecasts using real observations were improved relative to forecasts without data assimilation. The reliable forecast lead-time varied by model pool and is dependent on how tightly the C pool is coupled to meteorologically driven processes. The EAKF and similar state data assimilation techniques could reduce errors in projections of the land C sink and provide more robust forecasts of C pools and land-atmosphere exchanges.",

Then, synthetic temperature and salinity observations are assimilated along the track of the ferries in the second experiment. The results suggest that a FerryBox network in the Sea of Marmara has potential to improve the forecasts significantly. The salinity and temperature errors get smaller in the upper layer of the water column. The impact of the assimilation is negligible in the lower layer due to the strong stratification. The circulation in the Sea of Marmara, particularly the Bosphorus outflow, helps to propagate the error reduction towards the western basin where no assimilation is performed. Overall, the proposed FerryBox network can be a good start to designing an optimal sustained marine observing network in the Sea of Marmara for assimilation purposes.",

		"abstract": "Abstract A 50-member convection-allowing ensemble is used to examine effects of daytime PBL evolution and ambient flow interacting with modest terrain features on convection initiation (CI) in the lee of the Rocky Mountains. The examined case (4 June 2015) has isolated supercell storms that initiate during mid- to late afternoon along the northern portion of the Palmer Lake Divide, which is a ~0.5-km-deep zonally oriented terrain feature in east-central Colorado that extends eastward from the Rocky Mountains. To diagnose factors most crucial to storm development, two 10-member subensembles are constructed from the full 50-member ensemble. One subensemble (STRONG) has storm locations with mature storm intensities, and average timing of CI similar to that observed. The other subensemble (WEAK) has fewer storms, with generally weaker intensity, and delayed CI. Environmental composites constructed from these subensembles reveal a stronger surface horizontal convergence zone and moisture gradient in STRONG, resulting from 2–3.5 m s−1 stronger southerly winds on the south flank of the convergence zone. The stronger southerlies result from accelerated PBL growth and momentum mixing in the presence of strong low-to-midtropospheric vertical shear, which is facilitated by reduced above-PBL static stability in the composite STRONG initial condition. Stronger time-averaged low-to-midtropospheric upward motion coincides with the surface convergence zone in STRONG, and individual CI locations occur at the northeastern edge of the composite vertical motion maximum. Trajectory analysis with STRONG members confirms that the CI locations are consistent with large vertical displacements, and corresponding relative humidity increases leading to decreases in convective inhibition, as the southerly airstream ascends across the convergence zone.",

		"abstract": "The capability to forecast conditions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is investigated based on 30-day hindcast experiments that were initialized bimonthly during 2009 and 2010. The hindcasts were performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. Analysis of the WACCMX+DART hindcasts reveals several important features that are relevant to forecasting the middle atmosphere. The results show a clear dependence on spatial scale, with the slowest error growth occurring in the zonal mean and the fastest error growth occurring for small-scale waves. The error growth rate is also found to be significantly greater in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere compared to in the upper stratosphere to lower mesosphere, suggesting that the forecast skill decreases with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that the errors in the lower thermosphere reach saturation, on average, in less than 5 days, at least with the current version of WACCMX+DART. A seasonal dependency to the error growth is found at high latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres but not in the tropics or global average. We additionally investigate the error growth rates for migrating and nonmigrating atmospheric tides and find that the errors saturate after ∼5 days for tides in the lower thermosphere. The results provide an initial assessment of the error growth rates in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and are relevant for understanding how whole atmosphere models can potentially improve space weather forecasting.",

		"abstract": "Abstract This work investigates the sensitivity of wind speed forecasts during wind ramp events to parameters within a numerical weather prediction model boundary layer physics scheme. In a novel way, it explores how these sensitivities vary across 1) ensemble members with different initial conditions, 2) different times during the events, 3) different types of ramp-causing events, and 4) different horizontal grid spacing. Previous research finds that a small number of parameters in the surface layer and boundary layer schemes are responsible for the majority of the forecast uncertainty. In this study, the values of parameters within the Mellor–Yamada–Nakahishi–Niino (MYNN) boundary layer scheme and the MM5 surface layer scheme of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model are perturbed in a systematic way to evaluate parametric sensitivity for two types of specific ramp-causing phenomena: marine pushes and stable mix-out events. This work is part of the Department of Energy’s Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2). A major finding of this study is that there are large differences in parametric sensitivity between members of the same initial condition ensemble for all cases. These variations in sensitivity are the result of differences in the atmospheric state within the initial condition ensemble, and the parametric sensitivity changes over the course of each forecast. Finally, parametric sensitivity changes between event type and with model resolution. These conclusions are particularly relevant for future sensitivity studies and efforts at model tuning.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An object-based verification method for short-term, storm-scale probabilistic forecasts was developed and applied to mesocyclone guidance produced by the experimental Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) in 63 cases from 2017 to 2018. The probabilistic mesocyclone guidance was generated by calculating gridscale ensemble probabilities from WoFS forecasts of updraft helicity (UH) in layers 2–5 km (midlevel) and 0–2 km (low-level) above ground level (AGL) aggregated over 60-min periods. The resulting ensemble probability swaths are associated with individual thunderstorms and treated as objects with a single, representative probability value prescribed. A mesocyclone probability object, conceptually, is a region bounded by the ensemble forecast envelope of a mesocyclone track for a given thunderstorm over 1 h. The mesocyclone probability objects were matched against rotation track objects in Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor data using the total interest score, but with the maximum displacement varied between 0, 9, 15, and 30 km. Forecast accuracy and reliability were assessed at four different forecast lead time periods: 0–60, 30–90, 60–120, and 90–150 min. In the 0–60-min forecast period, the low-level UH probabilistic forecasts had a POD, FAR, and CSI of 0.46, 0.45, and 0.31, respectively, with a probability threshold of 22.2% (the threshold of maximum CSI). In the 90–150-min forecast period, the POD and CSI dropped to 0.39 and 0.27 while FAR remained relatively unchanged. Forecast probabilities > 60% overpredicted the likelihood of observed mesocyclones in the 0–60-min period; however, reliability improved when allowing larger maximum displacements for object matching and at longer lead times.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Snow cover affects the thermal conditions of the Tibetan Plateau through snow–albedo feedback and snowmelt, which, in turn, modulates the Asian summer monsoon climate. An accurate estimation of the snow condition on the Tibetan Plateau is therefore of great importance in both seasonal forecasts and climate studies. Estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) over the Tibetan Plateau is challenging due to the high altitude, complex terrain, and insufficient in situ observations. Multiple SWE products derived from satellite estimates, reanalyses, regional climate model simulations, and land data assimilations are intercompared in terms of daily, seasonal, and annual variations and are then evaluated against in situ SWE observations. The results show a relatively consistent seasonal to interannual variability of the SWE estimates among the products. The discrepancies in magnitude are large, however, especially in winter and spring. Evaluation against in situ SWE observations indicates that none of these products is capable of accurately characterizing both the spatial pattern and temporal variations.",

The 2017 CLUE included 81 members that all used 3-km horizontal grid spacing over the CONUS, enabling direct comparison of forecasts generated using different dynamical cores, physics schemes, and initialization procedures. This study uses forecasts from several of the 2017 CLUE members and one operational model to evaluate and compare CAM representation and next-day prediction of thunderstorms. The analysis utilizes existing techniques and novel, object-based techniques that distill important information about modeled and observed storms from many cases. The National Severe Storms Laboratory Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor product suite is used to verify model forecasts and climatologies of observed variables. Unobserved model fields are also examined to further illuminate important intermodel differences in storms and near-storm environments. No single model performed better than the others in all respects. However, there were many systematic intermodel and intercore differences in specific forecast metrics and model fields. Some of these differences can be confidently attributed to particular differences in model design. Model intercomparison studies similar to the one presented here are important to better understand the impacts of model and ensemble configurations on storm forecasts and to help optimize future operational CAM systems.",

We assimilate surface in situ observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10), and satellite aerosol optical depth to adjust the related anthropogenic emissions as well as the chemical initial conditions. We validate our forecast results out to 72 hr by comparison with the in situ observations. Results show that updated emissions improve the model performance between 10% and 65% root mean square error reduction for the assimilated species except particulate matter with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5-10), which is slightly improved due to the limited anthropogenic contribution to it. In a sensitivity experiment with a different update interval, the CO improvement is found to be sensitive to the cycling time used to update the CO emissions. In another sensitivity experiment when NO2 observations are not assimilated and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission are adjusted by only O3, NO2 forecasts show similar root mean square error improvement but have lower spatial correlation, indicating the value and limitation of the O3-NOx cross-variable relationship.",

		"abstract": "Numerical weather prediction models tend to underestimate cloud presence and therefore often overestimate global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The assimilation of cloud water path (CWP) retrievals from geostationary satellites using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) led to improved short-term GHI forecasts of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in midlatitudes in case studies. An evaluation of the method under tropical conditions and a quantification of this improvement for study periods of more than a few days are still missing. This paper focuses on the assimilation of CWP retrievals in three phases (ice, supercooled, and liquid) in a 6-hourly cycling procedure and on the impact of this method on short-term forecasts of GHI for Réunion Island, a tropical island in the southwest Indian Ocean. The multilayer gridded cloud properties of NASA Langley's Satellite ClOud and Radiation Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) are assimilated using the EnKF of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Manhattan release (revision 12002) and the advanced research WRF (ARW) v3.9.1.1. The ability of the method to improve cloud analyses and GHI forecasts is demonstrated, and a comparison using independent radiosoundings shows a reduction of specific humidity bias in the WRF analyses, especially in the low and middle troposphere. Ground-based GHI observations at 12 sites on Réunion Island are used to quantify the impact of CWP DA. Over a total of 44&thinsp;d during austral summertime, when averaged over all sites, CWP data assimilation has a positive impact on GHI forecasts for all lead times between 5 and 14&thinsp;h. Root mean square error and mean absolute error are reduced by 4&thinsp;% and 3&thinsp;%, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Abstract It is possible to describe many variants of ensemble Kalman filters without loss of generality as the impact of a single observation on a single state variable. For most ensemble algorithms commonly applied to Earth system models, the computation of increments for the observation variable ensemble can be treated as a separate step from computing increments for the state variable ensemble. The state variable increments are normally computed from the observation increments by linear regression using the prior bivariate ensemble of the state and observation variable. Here, a new method that replaces the standard regression with a regression using the bivariate rank statistics is described. This rank regression is expected to be most effective when the relation between a state variable and an observation is nonlinear. The performance of standard versus rank regression is compared for both linear and nonlinear forward operators (also known as observation operators) using a low-order model. Rank regression in combination with a rank histogram filter in observation space produces better analyses than standard regression for cases with nonlinear forward operators and relatively large analysis error. Standard regression, in combination with either a rank histogram filter or an ensemble Kalman filter in observation space, produces the best results in other situations.",

		"abstract": "The Andenes specular meteor radar shows meteor trail diffusion rates increasing on average by about 10&thinsp;% at times and locations where a lidar observes noctilucent clouds (NLCs). This high-latitude effect has been attributed to the presence of charged NLC after exploring possible contributions from thermal tides. To make this claim, the current study evaluates data from three stations at high, middle, and low latitudes for the years 2012 to 2016 to show that NLC influence on the meteor trail diffusion is independent of thermal tides. The observations also show that the meteor trail diffusion enhancement during NLC cover exists only at high latitudes and near the peaks of NLC layers. This paper discusses a number of possible explanations for changes in the regions with NLCs and leans towards the hypothesis that the relative abundance of background electron density plays the leading role. A more accurate model of the meteor trail diffusion around NLC particles would help researchers determine mesospheric temperature and neutral density profiles from meteor radars at high latitudes.",

		"abstract": "We investigate regional sources contributing to CO during the Korea United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign conducted over Korea (1 May to 10 June 2016) using 17 tagged CO simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry (CAM-chem). The simulations use three spatial resolutions, three anthropogenic emission inventories, two meteorological fields, and nine emission scenarios. These simulations are evaluated against measurements from the DC-8 aircraft and Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT). Results show that simulations using bottom-up emissions are consistently lower (bias: −34 to −39%) and poorer performing (Taylor skill: 0.38–0.61) than simulations using alternative anthropogenic emissions (bias: −6 to −33%; Taylor skill: 0.48–0.86), particularly for enhanced Asian CO and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission scenarios, suggesting underestimation in modeled CO background and emissions in the region. The ranges of source contributions to modeled CO along DC-8 aircraft from Korea and southern (90°E to 123°E, 20°N to 29°N), middle (90°E to 123°E, 29°N to 38.5°N), and northern (90°E to 131.5°E, 38.5°N to 45°N) East Asia (EA) are 6–13%, 5%, 16–28%, and 9–18%, respectively. CO emissions from middle and northern EA can reach Korea via transport within the boundary layer, whereas those from southern EA are transported to Korea mainly through the free troposphere. Emission contributions from middle EA dominate during continental outflow events (29–51%), while Korean emissions play an overall more important role for ground sites (up to 25–49%) and plumes within the boundary layer (up to 25–44%) in Korea. Finally, comparisons with four other source contribution approaches (FLEXPART 9.1 back trajectory calculations driven by Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) WRF inert tracer, China signature VOCs, and CO to CO2 enhancement ratios) show general consistency with CAM-chem.",

		"abstract": "The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial parameter for understanding the exchanges of mass and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In this study, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) has been successfully coupled to the Community Land Model with explicit carbon and nitrogen components (CLM4CN) by assimilating Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI data. Within this framework, four sequential assimilation algorithms, including the kernel filter (KF), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjust Kalman filter (EAKF), and the particle filter (PF), are thoroughly analyzed and compared. The results show that assimilating GLASS LAI into the CLM4CN is an effective method for improving model performance. In detail, the assimilation accuracies of the EnKF and EAKF algorithms are better than those of the KF and PF algorithm. From the perspective of the average and RMSD, the PF algorithm performs worse than the EAKF and EnKF algorithms because of the gradually reduced acceptance of observations with assimilation steps. In other words, the contribution of the observations to the posterior probability during the assimilation process is reduced. The EAKF algorithm is the best method because the matrix is adjusted at each time step during the assimilation procedure. If all the observations are accepted, the analyzed LAI seem to be better than that when some observations are rejected, especially in low-latitude regions.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Convection intensity and longevity is highly dependent on the surrounding environment. Ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA), which quantitatively and qualitatively interprets impacts of initial conditions on forecasts, is applied to very short-term (1–2 h) convective-scale forecasts for three cases during the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX) in 2013. The ESA technique reveals several dependencies of individual convective storm evolution on their nearby environments. The three MPEX cases are simulated using a previously verified 36-member convection-allowing model (Δx = 3 km) ensemble created via the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Radar and other conventional observations are assimilated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. The three cases include a mesoscale convective system (MCS) and both nontornadic and tornadic supercells. Of the many ESAs applied in this study, one of the most notable is the positive sensitivity of supercell updraft helicity to increases in both storm inflow region deep and shallow vertical wind shear. This result suggests that larger values of vertical wind shear within the storm inflow yield higher values of storm updraft helicity. Results further show that the supercell storms quickly enhance the environmental vertical wind shear within the storm inflow region. Application of ESA shows that these storm-induced perturbations then affect further storm evolution, suggesting the presence of storm–environment feedback cycles where perturbations affect future mesocyclone strength. Overall, ESA can provide insight into convection dependencies on the near-storm environment.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The ability of Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) and Doppler lidar (DL) wind profile observations to impact short-term forecasts of convection is explored by assimilating retrievals into a partially cycled convection-allowing ensemble analysis and forecast system. AERI and DL retrievals were obtained over 12 days using a mobile platform that was deployed in the preconvective and near-storm environments of thunderstorms during the afternoon in the U.S. Great Plains. The observation locations were guided by real-time ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) fields. AERI retrievals of temperature and dewpoint and DL retrievals of the horizontal wind components were assimilated into a control experiment that only assimilated conventional observations. Using the fractions skill score within 25-km neighborhoods, it is found that the assimilation of the AERI and DL retrievals results in far more times when the forecasts are improved than degraded in the 6-h forecast period. However, statistical confidence in the improvements often is not high and little to no relationships between the ESA fields and the actual changes in spread and skill is found. But, the focus on convective initiation and early convective evolution—a challenging forecast problem—and the fact that frequent improvements were seen despite observations from only one system over a limited period, provides encouragement to continue exploring the benefits of ground-based profilers to supplement the current upper-air observing system for severe weather forecasting applications.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Model errors and sampling errors produce inaccurate sample covariances that limit the performance of ensemble Kalman filters. Linearly hybridizing the flow-dependent ensemble-based covariance with a time-invariant background covariance matrix gives a better estimate of the true error covariance. Previous studies have shown this, both in theory and in practice. How to choose the weight for each covariance remains an open question especially in the presence of model biases. This study assumes the weighting coefficient to be a random variable and then introduces a Bayesian scheme to estimate it using the available data. The scheme takes into account the discrepancy between the ensemble mean and the observations, the ensemble variance, the static background variance, and the uncertainties in the observations. The proposed algorithm is first derived for a spatially constant weight and then this assumption is relaxed by estimating a unique scalar weight for each state variable. Using twin experiments with the 40-variable Lorenz 96 system, it is shown that the proposed scheme is able to produce quality forecasts even in the presence of severe sampling errors. The adaptive algorithm allows the hybrid filter to switch between an EnKF and a simple EnOI depending on the statistics of the ensemble. In the presence of model errors, the adaptive scheme demonstrates additional improvements compared with standard enhancements alone, such as inflation and localization. Finally, the potential of the spatially varying variant to accommodate challenging sparse observation networks is demonstrated. The computational efficiency and storage of the proposed scheme, which remain an obstacle, are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The correspondence between mean sea surface temperature (SST) biases in retrospective seasonal forecasts (hindcasts) and long-term climate simulations from five global climate models is examined to diagnose the degree to which systematic SST biases develop on seasonal time scales. The hindcasts are from the North American Multimodel Ensemble, and the climate simulations are from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The analysis suggests that most robust climatological SST biases begin to form within 6 months of a realistically initialized integration, although the growth rate varies with location, time, and model. In regions with large biases, interannual variability and ensemble spread is much smaller than the climatological bias. Additional ensemble hindcasts of the Community Earth System Model with a different initialization method suggest that initial conditions do matter for the initial bias growth, but the overall global bias patterns are similar after 6 months. A hindcast approach is more suitable to study biases over the tropics and subtropics than over the extratropics because of smaller initial biases and faster bias growth. The rapid emergence of SST biases makes it likely that fast processes with time scales shorter than the seasonal time scales in the atmosphere and upper ocean are responsible for a substantial part of the climatological SST biases. Studying the growth of biases may provide important clues to the causes and ultimately the amelioration of these biases. Further, initialized seasonal hindcasts can profitably be used in the development of high-resolution coupled ocean–atmosphere models.",

		"abstract": "A new Hybrid ensemble data assimilation system is implemented with a Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) of the Red Sea. The system is based on the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and combines a time-varying ensemble generated by the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) with a pre-selected quasi-static (monthly varying) ensemble as used in an Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) scheme. The goal is to develop an efficient system that enhances the state estimate and model forecasting skill in the Red Sea with reduced computational load compared to the EAKF. Observations of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST), altimeter sea-surface height (SSH), and in situ temperature and salinity profiles are assimilated to evaluate the new system. The performance of the Hybrid scheme (hereafter Hybrid-EAKF) is assessed with respect to the EnOI and the EAKF results. The comparisons are based on the daily averaged forecasts against satellite SST and SSH measurements and independent in situ temperature and salinity profiles. Hybrid-EAKF yields significant improvements in terms of ocean state estimates compared to both EnOI and EAKF, in particular mitigating for dynamical imbalances that affect EnOI. Hybrid-EAKF improves the estimation of SST and SSH root-mean-square differences by up to 20% compared to EAKF. High-resolution mesoscale eddy features, which dominate the Red Sea circulation, are further better represented in Hybrid-EAKF. Important reduction, by about 75%, in computational cost is also achieved with the Hybrid-EAKF system compared to the EAKF. These significant improvements were obtained with the Hybrid-EAKF after accounting for uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing and internal model physics in the time-varying ensemble.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

		"abstract": "In the tropical lower troposphere, the radio occultation (RO) bending angle can have complex and sharp structures. In current numerical weather prediction data assimilation, the estimated observation uncertainty (or error) of the RO bending angle is typically derived from a fixed-fraction uncertainty model of the RO bending angle. Therefore, the complex and sharp structures can exist in the observation uncertainty as well. This study investigates a potential analysis bias induced in the assimilation of COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) RO bending angles as a result of these complex and sharp structures in the observation uncertainty in the tropical troposphere. It is demonstrated that the complex structures can create a clear negative bias, up to −0.7%, in the bending angle space in the regional analysis with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF analyses and backgrounds also show a larger bias from the COSMIC RO bending angles.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An extension to standard ensemble Kalman filter algorithms that can improve performance for non-Gaussian prior distributions, non-Gaussian likelihoods, and bounded state variables is described. The algorithm exploits the capability of the rank histogram filter (RHF) to represent arbitrary prior distributions for observed variables. The rank histogram algorithm can be applied directly to state variables to produce posterior marginal ensembles without the need for regression that is part of standard ensemble filters. These marginals are used to adjust the marginals obtained from a standard ensemble filter that uses regression to update state variables. The final posterior ensemble is obtained by doing an ordered replacement of the posterior marginal ensemble values from a standard ensemble filter with the values obtained from the rank histogram method applied directly to state variables; the algorithm is referred to as the marginal adjustment rank histogram filter (MARHF). Applications to idealized bivariate problems and low-order dynamical systems show that the MARHF can produce better results than standard ensemble methods for priors that are non-Gaussian. Like the original RHF, the MARHF can also make use of arbitrary non-Gaussian observation likelihoods. The MARHF also has advantages for problems with bounded state variables, for instance, the concentration of an atmospheric tracer. Bounds can be automatically respected in the posterior ensembles. With an efficient implementation of the MARHF, the additional cost has better scaling than the standard RHF.",

		"abstract": "The present study describes a newly developed LMDZ–DART data assimilation system based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with a stretched grid atmospheric model and evaluates the potential of the system for generating high-resolution reanalysis products over the Indian region. This system is composed using the LMDZ5 (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, Zoom, version 5) global atmospheric model, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), and a set of interface routines. The interface routines enable assimilation of observations with the model using the EnKF assimilation method. The stretched grid capability of the LMDZ5 model has been utilized to generate computationally efficient high-resolution experimental reanalysis data over the Indian region. The assimilation experiments have been conducted for 4 months during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) period using LMDZ–DART system with two different configurations: REG (1° × 1° regular grid size over the globe) and ZOOM (~ 0.35° × 35° over the Indian region and coarser resolution outside). The results of the assimilation experiments are validated by comparing with observations as well as with an independent atmospheric reanalysis (ERA-Interim). It has been found that LMDZ–DART system is robust and reliable throughout the investigated ISM period for both REG and ZOOM configurations. In the REG experiment, spatial patterns and magnitude of the global fields portray a high degree of resemblance with ERA-Interim. The spatial patterns are also well reproduced in the ZOOM reanalysis. However, at some places outside the zoom area, the differences of the ZOOM reanalysis with ERA-Interim are slightly higher than the regular grid. Over the Indian region, the ZOOM configuration provides higher quality analysis and better regional features than REG. These results thus provide confidence in the stretched grid LMDZ–DART system to serve as a basis for generating computationally economical high-resolution regional reanalysis.",

		"abstract": "Three types of observations, aerosol optical depth from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, surface particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10), and aerosol extinction coefficient (AEXT) profiles from ground-based lidars, were separately and simultaneously assimilated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with the Chemistry/Data Assimilation Research Testbed (WRF-Chem/DART). Two cases in June and November 2018 were selected over middle and eastern China. Experiments assimilating single-type and multiple observations were evaluated by cross validating their analysis and forecast against the three observation types. Compared to the experiment without data assimilation (DA), DA of single-type observations is always closer to the type of observations assimilated. However, DA of aerosol optical depth or AEXT sometimes significantly degraded the error performance for PM2.5. This problem is caused by the inconsistency of bias tendencies when modeling aerosol optical properties and surface aerosol mass. It is found that WRF-Chem tends to predict dryer air within the boundary layer over eastern China, which may have played a role in the underestimation of AEXT even when PM2.5 was overestimated. After applying a simple bias correction (BC), the problem was alleviated. DA of multiple observations with BC gives the best overall error performance when validated against all types of observations and even performs better than any DA of single-type observations experiments in reproducing AEXT profiles. The results illustrate that BC is important in DA of multiple observations and that the simultaneous DA of aerosol observations with different vertical information can work synergistically to improve aerosol forecasts.",

		"abstract": "A new prototype coupled ocean–atmosphere Ensemble Kalman Filter reanalysis product, the Community Earth System Model using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (CESM-DART), is studied by comparing its tropical climate variability to other reanalysis products, available observations, and a free-running version of the model. The results reveal that CESM-DART produces fields that are comparable in overall performance with those of four other uncoupled and coupled reanalyses. The clearest signature of differences in CESM-DART is in the analysis of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) and other tropical atmospheric waves. MJO energy is enhanced over the free-running CESM as well as compared to the other products, suggesting the importance of the surface flux coupling at the ocean–atmosphere interface in organizing convective activity. In addition, high-frequency Kelvin waves in CESM-DART are reduced in amplitude compared to the free-running CESM run and the other products, again supportive of the oceanic coupling playing a role in this difference. CESM-DART also exhibits a relatively low bias in the mean tropical precipitation field and mean sensible heat flux field. Conclusive evidence of the importance of coupling on data assimilation performance will require additional detailed direct comparisons with identically formulated, uncoupled data assimilation runs.",

		"abstract": "Abstract An ensemble seasonal hindcast approach is used to investigate the development of the equatorial Pacific Ocean cold sea surface temperature (SST) bias and its characteristic annual cycle in the Community Earth System Model, version 1 (CESM1). In observations, eastern equatorial Pacific SSTs exhibit a warm phase during boreal spring and a cold phase during late boreal summer–autumn. The CESM1 climatology shows a cold bias during both warm and cold phases. In our hindcasts, the cold bias during the cold phase develops in less than 6 months, whereas the cold bias during the warm phase takes longer to emerge. The fast-developing cold-phase cold bias is associated with too-strong vertical advection and easterly wind stress over the eastern equatorial region. The antecedent boreal summer easterly wind anomalies also appear in atmosphere-only simulations, indicating that the errors are intrinsic to the atmosphere component. For the slower-developing warm-phase cold bias, we find that the too-cold SSTs over the equatorial region are associated with a slowly evolving upward displacement of subsurface ocean zonal currents and isotherms that can be traced to the ocean component.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Deficiencies in forecast models commonly stem from inadequate representation of physical processes; yet, improvement to any single physics component within a model may lead to degradations in other physics components or the model as a whole. In this study, a systematic investigation of physics tendencies is demonstrated to help identify and correct compensating sources of model biases. The model improvement process is illustrated by addressing a commonly known issue in warm-season rainfall forecasts from parameterized convection models: the misrepresentation of the diurnal precipitation cycle over land, especially in its timing. Recent advances in closure assumptions in mass-flux cumulus schemes have made remarkable improvements in this respect. Here, we investigate these improvements in the representation of the diurnal precipitation cycle for a spring period over the United States, and how changes to the cumulus scheme impact the model climate and the behavior of other physics schemes. The modified cumulus scheme improves both the timing of the diurnal precipitation cycle and reduces midtropospheric temperature and moisture biases. However, larger temperature and moisture biases are found in the boundary layer as compared to a predecessor scheme, along with an overamplification of the diurnal precipitation cycle, relative to observations. Guided by a tendency analysis, we find that biases in the diurnal amplitude of the precipitation cycle in our simulations, along with temperature and moisture biases in the boundary layer, originate from the land surface model.",

Here we provide a perspective on how satellite observations could be better used to understand and constrain CFE. We then highlight data assimilation (DA) as an effective way to reconcile different satellite datasets and systematically constrain carbon uptake trends in Earth System Models. As a proof-of-concept, we show that joint DA of multiple independent satellite datasets reduced model ensemble error by better constraining unobservable processes and variables, including those directly impacted by CFE.

		"abstract": "The Taiwan mesoscale ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF), also called WEPS, is designed to provide reliable ensemble forecasts for the East Asian region centered on Taiwan. The most skillful ensemble is obtained if model-uncertainty is represented in addition to initial condition uncertainty. A number of numerical prediction experiments are conducted to obtain the optimal configuration consisting of multiple physics-schemes, and two stochastic parameterization schemes: The Stochastic-Kinetic Energy Backscatter (SKEB) Scheme and the Stochastically Perturbed of Physics-Tendency (SPPT) scheme. The performance of the best configuration of WEPS is objectively verified against ECMWF reanalysis and a high-resolution simulation. Further analysis finds little impact of the stochastic schemes on quantitative precipitation forecasts and a single Typhoon case study. We conclude that for best performance over the East Asian domain, stochastic parameterizations alone are not sufficient to represent model-uncertainty and need to be augmented with a multi- physics suite.",

		"abstract": "An ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) data assimilation system for a high-resolution (0.1° horizontal) version of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) ocean component is presented. For this purpose, a new version of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART Manhattan) that enables large-state data assimilation by distributing state vector information across multiple processors at high resolution is used. The EnOI scheme uses a static (but seasonally varying) 84-member ensemble of precomputed perturbations to approximate samples from the forecast error covariance and utilizes a single model integration to estimate the forecast mean. Satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature observations along with in situ temperature and salinity observations are assimilated. This new data assimilation framework is then used to produce a global high-resolution retrospective analysis for the 2005–2016 period. Not surprisingly, the assimilation is shown to generally improve the time-mean ocean state estimate relative to an identically forced ocean model simulation where no observations are ingested. However, diminished improvements are found in undersampled regions. Lack of adequate salinity observations in the upper ocean actually results in deterioration of salinity there. The EnOI scheme is found to provide a practical and cost-effective alternative to the use of an ensemble of forecasts.",

		"abstract": "Global coupled chemistry–climate models underestimate carbon monoxide (CO) in the Northern Hemisphere, exhibiting a pervasive negative bias against measurements peaking in late winter and early spring. While this bias has been commonly attributed to underestimation of direct anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions, chemical production and loss via OH reaction from emissions of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role. Here we investigate the reasons for this underestimation using aircraft measurements taken in May and June 2016 from the Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) experiment in South Korea and the Air Chemistry Research in Asia (ARIAs) in the North China Plain (NCP). For reference, multispectral CO retrievals (V8J) from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) are jointly assimilated with meteorological observations using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within the global Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-Chem) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). With regard to KORUS-AQ data, CO is underestimated by 42&thinsp;% in the control run and by 12&thinsp;% with the MOPITT assimilation run. The inversion suggests an underestimation of anthropogenic CO sources in many regions, by up to 80&thinsp;% for northern China, with large increments over the Liaoning Province and the North China Plain (NCP). Yet, an often-overlooked aspect of these inversions is that correcting the underestimation in anthropogenic CO emissions also improves the comparison with observational O3 datasets and observationally constrained box model simulations of OH and HO2. Running a CAM-Chem simulation with the updated emissions of anthropogenic CO reduces the bias by 29&thinsp;% for CO, 18&thinsp;% for ozone, 11&thinsp;% for HO2, and 27&thinsp;% for OH. Longer-lived anthropogenic VOCs whose model errors are correlated with CO are also improved, while short-lived VOCs, including formaldehyde, are difficult to constrain solely by assimilating satellite retrievals of CO. During an anticyclonic episode, better simulation of O3, with an average underestimation of 5.5&thinsp;ppbv, and a reduction in the bias of surface formaldehyde and oxygenated VOCs can be achieved by separately increasing by a factor of 2 the modeled biogenic emissions for the plant functional types found in Korea. Results also suggest that controlling VOC and CO emissions, in addition to widespread NOx controls, can improve ozone pollution over East Asia.",

We explore the feasibility and benefits of applying an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate parameters in the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE). Parameter estimation (PE) is applied to the highly influential dry snow grain radius and combined with state estimation in a series of perfect model observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). Allowing the parameter to vary in space improves performance along the sea ice edge but degrades in the central Arctic compared to requiring the parameter to be uniform everywhere, suggesting that spatially varying parameters will likely improve PE performance at local scales and should be considered with caution. We compare experiments with both PE and state estimation to experiments with only the latter and have found that the benefits of PE mostly occur after the data assimilation period, when no observations are available to assimilate (i.e., the forecast period), which suggests PE's relevance for improving seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice.",

The lower atmospheric and GOLD L2 temperature (Tdisk) are assimilated in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension using Data Assimilation Research Testbed. It is found that inclusion of the GOLD Tdisk improves the forecast root mean square error (RMSE) and bias by 5% and 71%. When compared to lower atmosphere only assimilation, the improvements in RMSE and bias are 20% and 94%. An investigation of the global diurnal westward-propagating wavenumber 1 (DW1) and local diurnal tidal characteristics shows that inclusion of the GOLD temperatures improves the DW1 by about 8% and diurnal tide by more than 17%. Larger percentage improvements in the tides are seen in the lower thermosphere. Considerable improvements in the model state are also seen at times and locations where there are no GOLD observations available. These results and the background data assimilation procedure are presented here, which demonstrate that GOLD thermospheric temperature is an excellent data set that can be used for thermospheric assimilation studies and operational purposes.",

		"abstract": "Ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) is a variant of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) that operates with a static ensemble to drastically reduce its computational cost. The idea is to use a pre-selected ensemble to parameterize the background covariance matrix, which avoids the costly integration of the ensemble members with the dynamical model during the forecast step of the filtering process. To better represent the pronounced time-varying circulation of the Red Sea, we propose a new adaptive EnOI approach in which the ensemble members are adaptively selected at every assimilation cycle from a large dictionary of ocean states describing the Red Sea variability. We implement and test different schemes to select the ensemble members (i) based on the similarity to the forecast state according to some criteria, or (ii) in term of best representation of the forecast in an ensemble subspace using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The relevance of the schemes is first demonstrated with the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 models. Then results of numerical experiments assimilating real remote sensing data into a high resolution MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) of the Red Sea using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) system are presented and discussed.",

		"abstract": "Forecast Sensitivity of an extreme rainfall event over the Uttarakhand state located in the Western Himalayas is investigated through Ensemble-based Sensitivity Analysis (ESA). ESA enables the assessment of forecast errors and its relation to the flow fields through linear regression approach. The ensembles are initialized from an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) Data Assimilation in Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. ESA is then applied to evaluate the dynamics and predictability at two different days of the extreme precipitation episode. Results indicate that the precipitation forecast over Uttarakhand is sensitive to the mid-tropospheric trough and moisture fields for both the days, in general. The day 1 precipitation shows negative sensitivity to the trough over upstream regions of the storm location while in day 2, the sensitive region is found to be located over the southward intruded branch of the mid–tropospheric trough. Perturbations introduced in the initial conditions (IC) over the most sensitive region over the west of the storm location indicate significant variations in the forecast location of precipitation. IC perturbed experiments show that the perturbation amplitude is correlated linearly with predicted change in precipitation, which becomes nonlinear as the forecast length increases. ESA performed on convection-permitting ensembles show that precipitation over the Uttarakhand is mostly non-convective. However, when the location of the response function box is moved north-westward of the Uttarakhand, the sensitivity patterns show signs of convection.",

		"abstract": "The dayside equatorial ionospheric electrodynamics exhibit strong variability driven simultaneously by highly changeable external forcings that originate from the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV), magnetosphere, and lower atmosphere. We investigate this variability by carrying out comprehensive data-driven ensemble modeling using a coupled model of the thermosphere and ionosphere, with the focus on the vertical E × B drift variability during a solar minimum and minor storm period. The variability of vertical E × B drift in response to the changes and uncertainty of primary forcings (i.e., solar EUV, high-latitude plasma convection and auroral particle precipitation, and lower-atmospheric tide and wave forcing) is investigated by ensemble forcing sensitivity experiments that incorporate data-driven stochastic perturbations of these forcings into the model. Second, the impact of assimilating FORMOsa SATellite-3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) electron density profiles (EDPs) on the reduction of uncertainty of the modeled vertical E × B drift variability resulting from inadequately specified external forcing is revealed. The Communication and Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) ion drift velocity observations are used for validation. The validation results support the importance of the use of a data-driven forcing perturbation methods in ensemble modeling and data assimilation. In conclusion, the solar EUV dominates the global-scale day-to-day variability, while the lower atmosphere tide and wave forcing is critical to determining the regional variability. The modeled vertical E × B drift is also sensitive to the magnetospheric forcing. The ensemble data assimilation of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC EDPs helps to reduce the uncertainty and improves agreement of the modeled vertical E × B drifts with C/NOFS observations.",

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the Midwestern United States were estimated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), with and without assimilating OCO-2 retrievals by the extended-DART. To focus on evaluating the effect of the assimilation, the study period was deliberately set to January 2016, the coldest month in the dormant season, to minimize the influence of biogenic CO2 flux. Independent ground-based and flight observations, as well as the CarbonTracker 2017 products (CT2017), were used to evaluate the results of two distinct approaches. Comparing to the estimated CO2 concentration distribution without assimilating the OCO-2 retrievals, the overall root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) between the results with the assimilation and the observations were averagely reduced by 20.65% and 78.49%, the overall difference in the RMSE and MBE with respect to CT2017 were averagely reduced by 48.29% and 28.61%, respectively. Experiments showed that the assimilation of OCO-2 retrievals by the extended-DART could make the estimated CO2 concentration distribution significantly more consistent with the observations and the CarbonTracker products.",

		"abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive comparison of the impact of solar activity on forecasting the upper atmosphere through assimilation of radio occultation (RO)-derived electron density (Ne) into a physics-based model (TIE-GCM) using an ensemble Kalman filter (KF). Globally abundant RO-derived Ne offers one of the most promising means to test the effect of assimilation on the model forecasted state on a global scale. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding how the assimilation results vary with solar activity, which is one of the main drivers of thermosphere-ionosphere dynamics. This study validates the forecast states with independent RO-derived GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission) Ne data. The principal result of the study is that the agreement between forecast Ne and data is better during solar minimum than solar maximum. The results also show that the agreement between data and forecast is mostly better than that of the standalone TIE-GCM driven with observed geophysical indices. The results emphasize that TIE-GCM significantly underestimate Ne in altitudes below 250 km and the assimilation of Ne is not as effective in these lower altitudes as it is in higher altitudes. The results demonstrate that assimilation of Ne significantly impacts the neutral mass density estimates via the KF state vector—the impact is larger during solar maximum than solar minimum relative to a control case that does not assimilate Ne. The results are useful to explain the inherent model bias, to understand the limitations of the data, and to demonstrate the capability of the assimilation technique.",

		"abstract": "The Western United States is dominated by natural lands that play a critical role for carbon balance, water quality, and timber reserves. This region is also particularly vulnerable to forest mortality from drought, insect attack, and wildfires, thus requiring constant monitoring to assess ecosystem health. Carbon monitoring techniques are challenged by the complex mountainous terrain, thus there is an opportunity for data assimilation systems that combine land surface models and satellite-derived observations to provide improved carbon monitoring. Here, we use the Data Assimilation Research Testbed to adjust the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) with remotely sensed observations of leaf area and above-ground biomass. The adjusted simulation significantly reduced the above-ground biomass and leaf area, leading to a reduction in both photosynthesis and respiration fluxes. The reduction in the carbon fluxes mostly offset, thus both the adjusted and free simulation projected a weak carbon sink to the land. This result differed from a separate observation-constrained model (FLUXCOM) that projected strong carbon uptake to the land. Simulation diagnostics suggested water limitation had an important influence upon the magnitude and spatial pattern of carbon uptake through photosynthesis. We recommend that additional observations important for water cycling (e.g., snow water equivalent, land surface temperature) be included to improve the veracity of the spatial pattern in carbon uptake. Furthermore, the assimilation system should be enhanced to maximize the number of the simulated state variables that are adjusted, especially those related to the recommended observed quantities including water cycling and soil carbon.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Due in part to sparse conventional observation coverage in the Antarctic region, atmospheric studies in this part of the globe often rely more heavily on numerical models. Model representation of atmospheric processes in the Antarctic remains inferior to representation in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Poor representation may be related to inaccurate model analyses that do not optimally utilize the limited observation network. Here, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation (DA) technique is employed in lieu of variational DA techniques to investigate impacts on model analysis accuracy. This DA technique [provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)] is coupled with a polar-modified, mesoscale numerical model that together compose Antarctic-DART (A-DART). A-DART is cycled with DA and run over a 1-month period, assimilating only conventional observations. Results show relatively good agreement between A-DART and observations. Comparison with radiosonde temperature and geostationary satellite wind observations shows large differences between RMSE and ensemble spread in the upper troposphere. The analysis increment shows large values in the eastern Atlantic–western Indian Oceans associated with geostationary satellite wind observations. Further evaluation determines that geostationary satellite wind observations may be biased in this region. Overall, this baseline demonstration of ensemble-based modeling applied in the Antarctic produced short-term forecasts that were competitive with two operational modeling systems while assimilating on the O(106) fewer observations. A-DART is capable of assimilating additional observations for a variety of applications. This study highlights the capability of applying this ensemble-based DA technique for process and forecast studies in an observation-sparse region.",

		"abstract": "The present study compares the performance of four data assimilation (DA) systems: Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), Variational (3DVAR/4DVAR), and Hybrid ensemble-3DVAR (HYBRID) in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. A heavy rainfall event that caused notorious floods in the Uttarakhand over the Himalayan region is considered. Observations are assimilated at every 6 h interval and all the conventional observations including cloud tracked-wind from the satellite available from Global Telecommunication System are used. The forecasts initialized from the analysis of four DA systems at different lead times are evaluated. Additionally, a non-cycled nested assimilation strategy that provides advantages of increased resolution in the DA system is tested. The results indicate that 4DVAR experiments produce more skillful forecasts for wind while both 4DVAR and EAKF experiments show improvement for upper tropospheric temperature forecasts as compared to the other experiments. The evaluation of rainfall forecast depicts that the 4DVAR DA system has outperformed the other DA systems when the effect of high-resolution assimilation is mimicked in the system using the nested assimilation strategy. Further analysis on the dynamics of the event indicates that an early merging of the southward protruding trough with the westward-moving monsoon depression has resulted in stronger southeastward flow in EAKF and HYBRID experiments, which is suggested as a potential reason for enhanced precipitation over the Uttarakhand in both the experiments.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Montana State University jointly developed water vapor micropulse differential absorption lidars (MPDs) that are a significant advance in eye-safe, unattended, lidar-based water vapor remote sensing. MPD is designed to provide continuous vertical water vapor profiles with high vertical (150 m) and temporal resolution (5 min) in the lower troposphere. This study aims to investigate MPD observation impacts and the scientific significance of MPDs for convective weather analyses and predictions using observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs). In this study, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) Model are used to conduct OSSEs for a case study of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) observed during the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) experiment. A poor-performing control simulation that was drawn from a 40-member ensemble at 3-km resolution is markedly improved by assimilation of simulated observations drawn from a more skillful simulation that served as the nature run at 1-km resolution. In particular, assimilating surface observations corrected surface warm front structure errors, while MPD observations remedied errors in low- to midlevel moisture ahead of the MCS. Collectively, these analyses changes led to markedly improved short-term predictions of convection initiation, evolution, and precipitation of the MCS in the simulations on 15 July 2015. For this case study, the OSSE results indicate that a more dense MPD network results in better prediction performance for convective precipitation while degrading light precipitation prediction performance due to an imbalance of the analysis at large scales.",

In this study, with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), we found that the influence of initial states errors persists throughout a vicious cycle and cannot be automatically remedied via consequent assimilations. As such, two strategies were applied to alleviate the initial state errors, and a reliable assimilation system was developed. Data assimilation experiments using oceanic observations were conducted over the period from 2005 to 2014 to investigate the impact of these different strategies. The evaluation revealed that the assimilation of observation-derived climatological data is an effective approach to reduce initial state errors and preserve the balance between different variables to the largest extent, which significantly improved the performance of the assimilation system in the investigated time period. It was further found that the developed assimilation system can produce high-quality oceanic analysis results comparable to the ECDA and GODAS, two widely used reanalysis products. Perspectives toward further improvement of coupled data assimilation are also outlined.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Convection-allowing model (CAM) ensemble forecasts provide quantitative probabilistic guidance of convective hazards that forecasters would otherwise qualitatively assess. Various initial condition (IC) strategies can be used to generate CAM probabilistic forecasts, but it is still unclear how different configurations perform. Schwartz et al. verified five 10-member IC CAM ensembles over one month of 0000 UTC initializations with a focus on precipitation. Here, we initialize four 42-member IC CAM ensembles every 12 h over 6 weeks and verify forecasts of precipitation, column maximum reflectivity, and hourly maximum updraft helicity. The Texas Tech University real-time EnKF ensemble and three additional IC ensemble modeling systems are verified. Holding the model configuration constant, additional ICs are generated by downscaling time-lagged Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) members, applying correlated random noise to Global Forecast System (GFS) analyses, and recentering EnKF perturbations about GFS analyses. We found that ensemble ICs constructed with correlated random noise and EnKF perturbations about GFS analyses both produced higher-quality precipitation forecasts than downscaled GEFS and EnKF strategies. However, downscaled GEFS and EnKF perturbations about GFS analyses frequently initialized more skillful forecasts of reflectivity than ICs with random perturbations, suggesting that flow-dependent perturbations are important for forecasting deep convection. Even with a suboptimal EnKF configuration, our findings still echo those of Schwartz et al. We extend their work by exploring 1) verification of additional convective hazards and 2) empirical scaling of IC perturbations as a computationally inexpensive method for improving CAM ensemble forecasts.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Obtaining a faithful probabilistic depiction of moist convection is complicated by unknown errors in subgrid-scale physical parameterization schemes, invalid assumptions made by data assimilation (DA) techniques, and high system dimensionality. As an initial step toward untangling sources of uncertainty in convective weather regimes, we evaluate a novel Bayesian data assimilation methodology based on particle filtering within a WRF ensemble analysis and forecasting system. Unlike most geophysical DA methods, the particle filter (PF) represents prior and posterior error distributions nonparametrically rather than assuming a Gaussian distribution and can accept any type of likelihood function. This approach is known to reduce bias introduced by Gaussian approximations in low-dimensional and idealized contexts. The form of PF used in this research adopts a dimension-reduction strategy, making it affordable for typical weather applications. The present study examines posterior ensemble members and forecasts for select severe weather events between 2019 and 2020, comparing results from the PF with those from an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). We find that assimilating with a PF produces posterior quantities for microphysical variables that are more consistent with model climatology than comparable quantities from an EnKF, which we attribute to a reduction in DA bias. These differences are significant enough to impact the dynamic evolution of convective systems via cold pool strength and propagation, with impacts to forecast verification scores depending on the particular microphysics scheme. Our findings have broad implications for future approaches to the selection of physical parameterization schemes and parameter estimation within preexisting data assimilation frameworks. Significance Statement The accurate prediction of severe storms using numerical weather models depends on effective parameterization schemes for small-scale processes and the assimilation of incomplete observational data in a manner that faithfully represents the probabilistic state of the atmosphere. Current generation methods for data assimilation typically assume a standard form for the error distributions of relevant quantities, which can introduce bias that not only hinders numerical prediction, but that can also confound the characterization of errors from the model itself. The current study performs data assimilation using a novel method that does not make such assumptions and explores characteristics of resulting model fields and forecasts that might make such a method useful for improving model parameterization schemes.",

The data assimilation system, used in this study, consists of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and the Community Earth System Model as the global forecast model. Based on the ensemble Kalman filter scheme, DART supports the radiative transfer model that is used to simulate the satellite radiances from the model state. To make the AMSU-A data available to be assimilated in DART, preprocessing modules are developed, which consist of quality control, spatial thinning, and bias correction processes. In the quality control, two sub-processes are included, outlier test and channel selection, depending on the cloud condition and surface type. The bias correction process is divided into scan-bias correction and air-mass-bias correction. Like input data used in DART, the observation errors are also estimated for the AMSU-A channels. In the trial experiments, a positive analysis impact is obtained by assimilating the AMSU-A observations on top of the DART data assimilation system that already makes use of the conventional measurements. In particular, the analysis errors are significantly reduced in the whole troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Northern Hemisphere. Overall, this study demonstrates a positive impact on the analysis when the AMSU-A observations are assimilated in the DART assimilation system.",

The idealised, homogeneous observation network provides profiles of wind and temperature data from the nature run for January 2018 using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) forced by the observed sea-surface temperature. The results show that the assimilation of abundant wind observations in a perfect model makes the temperature data in the Tropics largely uninformative. Furthermore, the assimilation of wind data reduces the background errors in specific humidity twice as much as the assimilation of temperature observations. In all experiments, the largest analysis uncertainties and the largest short-term forecast errors are found in regions of strong vertical and longitudinal gradients in the background wind, especially in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent. The horizontal error correlation scales are on average short throughout the troposphere, just several hundred km. The correlation scales of the wind variables in precipitating regions are half of those in nonprecipitating regions. In precipitating regions, the correlations are elongated vertically, especially for the wind variables. Strong positive cross-correlations between temperature and specific humidity in the precipitating regions are explained using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation.",

		"abstract": "Although data assimilation-based targeted observation approaches have been widely used, obtaining optimal observation sites over a specific region for a prediction target remains a challenge. Hence, this study developed a more practical region-optional targeted observation method by introducing a projection vector, allowing for the prediction targeted region to be different from the observation one. By minimizing the analysis error variance in a targeted region, the method identified optimal sites through a sequential assimilation framework. This region-optional method was applied in the targeted observation study of the sea surface temperature (SST) prediction associated with Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The first 10 optimal observation sites were identified, with seven sites in the west IO, and three in the east. The results were further validated by conducting observation system simulation experiments using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter assimilation system in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The assimilation of observations from the 10 optimal sites was capable of reducing root mean squared errors (RMSEs) by 38.2% when assessing the SST across the IOD key regions, significantly more than the reduction from 10 optimal sites identified via the conventional method, or that from 10 random sites. This improvement was primarily due to the error reduction in the eastern IO, where SST RMSEs were reduced by >50%. The proposed region-optional targeted observation method can seek optimal sites in any region of interest and is not confined to the targeted region as in conventional algorithms, thus providing a more reasonable method for designing optimal observation networks.",

In this article, we estimate the potential impact of assimilating cloud-affected satellite observations of visible (0.6 μ\\ \\upmu \\m) and near thermal infrared wavelengths (6.2 and 7.3 μ\\ \\upmu \\m) relative to the impact of assimilating radar reflectivity observations. We employed observing-system simulation experiments with a perfect-model forecast for two cases of strong convective summertime precipitation. Observations are simulated using the radiative transfer model RTTOV/MFASIS and assimilated by the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed. The Weather Research and Forecasting model at 2-km grid resolution was used for forecasts. Results show that satellite observations can be nearly as beneficial as three-dimensional radar reflectivity observations. Under favorable conditions, where the prior contains no error in the stage of storm development but only in horizontal position and strength, the assimilation of visible observations leads to 88% of the radar impact. Under more difficult conditions, the impact of visible and infrared observations still reached 50 and 79%, respectively.",

		"abstract": "The sparse wind observations and reanalysis winds in the mesosphere make it challenging to accurately determine the residual mean meridional circulation (MMC). As winds distribute tracers, an alternative approach is to utilize long-lived trace species such as water vapor (H2O). The recently released H2O data from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) version 2.07, combined with simulations by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtension with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM-X) and with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (WACCMX + DART), provide an opportunity to assess the accuracy of using H2O isopleths to derive the vertical component of the residual MMC during the 2009 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. In winter, the impact of photochemistry and diffusion on the distribution of mesospheric H2O is negligible compared to advective processes. H2O poleward of 70°N accurately captures the anomalous ascent that occurs a few days prior to the onset of the SSW and the subsequent descent. The derived vertical velocity in SD-WACCM-X and WACCMX + DART is qualitatively consistent with SABER observations. However, the derivation of vertical motion from isopleth analysis has limitations at the beginning of 2009 when the meridional transport is stronger than the vertical transport. While measuring winds in the mesosphere is challenging, satellite observations of mesospheric H2O prove to be an effective dynamical tracer during time periods characterized by strong vertical coupling.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Estimating and predicting the state of the atmosphere is a probabilistic problem for which an ensemble modeling approach often is taken to represent uncertainty in the system. Common methods for examining uncertainty and assessing performance for ensembles emphasize pointwise statistics or marginal distributions. However, these methods lose specific information about individual ensemble members. This paper explores contour band depth (cBD), a method of analyzing uncertainty in terms of contours of scalar fields. cBD is fully nonparametric and induces an ordering on ensemble members that leads to box-and-whisker-plot-type visualizations of uncertainty for two-dimensional data. By applying cBD to synthetic ensembles, we demonstrate that it provides enhanced information about the spatial structure of ensemble uncertainty. We also find that the usefulness of the cBD analysis depends on the presence of multiple modes and multiple scales in the ensemble of contours. Finally, we apply cBD to compare various convection-permitting forecasts from different ensemble prediction systems and find that the value it provides in real-world applications compared to standard analysis methods exhibits clear limitations. In some cases, contour boxplots can provide deeper insight into differences in spatial characteristics between the different ensemble forecasts. Nevertheless, identification of outliers using cBD is not always intuitive, and the method can be especially challenging to implement for flow that exhibits multiple spatial scales (e.g., discrete convective cells embedded within a mesoscale weather system). Significance Statement Predictions of Earth’s atmosphere inherently come with some degree of uncertainty owing to incomplete observations and the chaotic nature of the system. Understanding that uncertainty is critical when drawing scientific conclusions or making policy decisions from model predictions. In this study, we explore a method for describing model uncertainty when the quantities of interest are well represented by contours. The method yields a quantitative visualization of uncertainty in both the location and the shape of contours to an extent that is not possible with standard uncertainty quantification methods and may eventually prove useful for the development of more robust techniques for evaluating and validating numerical weather models.",

		"abstract": "We investigate the benefit of assimilating high spatial-temporal resolution nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measurements from a geostationary (GEO) instrument such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) versus a low-earth orbit (LEO) platform like TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the inverse modeling of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. We generated synthetic TEMPO and TROPOMI NO2 measurements based on emissions from the COVID-19 lockdown period. Starting with emissions levels prior to the lockdown, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry/Data Assimilation Research Testbed (WRF-Chem/DART) to assimilate these pseudo-observations in Observing System Simulation Experiments to adjust NOx emissions and quantify how well the assimilation of TEMPO versus TROPOMI measurements recovers the lockdown-induced emissions changes. We find that NOx emission biases can be ameliorated using half as many simulation days when assimilating GEO observations, and the estimated NOx emissions in 23 out of 29 major urban regions in the US are more accurate. The root mean square error and coefficient of determination of posterior NOx emissions are reduced by 12.5%–41.5% and 1.5%–17.1%, respectively, across different regions. We conduct sensitivity experiments that use different data assimilation (DA) configurations to assimilate synthetic GEO observations. Results demonstrate that the temporal width of the DA window introduces −10% to −20% biases in the emissions inversion and constraining both NOx concentrations and emissions simultaneously yields the most accurate NOx emissions estimates. Our work serves as a valuable reference on how to appropriately assimilate GEO observations for constraining NOx emissions in future studies.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Although radar is our most useful tool for monitoring severe weather, the benefits of assimilating its data are often short lived. To understand why, we documented the assimilation requirements, the data characteristics, and the common practices that could hinder optimum data assimilation by traditional approaches. Within storms, radars provide dense measurements of a few highly variable storm outcomes (precipitation and wind) in atmospherically unstable conditions. However, statistical relationships between errors of observed and unobserved quantities often become nonlinear because the errors in these areas tend to become large rapidly. Beyond precipitating areas lie large regions for which radars provide limited new information, yet whose properties will soon shape the outcome of future storms. For those areas, any innovation must consequently be projected from sometimes distant precipitating areas. Thus, radar data assimilation must contend with a double need at odds with many traditional assimilation implementations: correcting in-storm properties with complex errors while projecting information at unusually far distances outside precipitating areas. To further complicate the issue, other data properties and practices, such as assimilating reflectivity in logarithmic units, are not optimal to correct all state variables. Therefore, many characteristics of radar measurements and common practices of their assimilation are incompatible with necessary conditions for successful data assimilation. Facing these dataset-specific challenges may force us to consider new approaches that use the available information differently.",

		"abstract": "Sulphate (SO42−) is a main component of PM2.5 in China. The chemical formation mechanisms of sulphate are complex, and many air quality models have been used to analyse these mechanisms. To improve the accuracy of Weather Research Forecast-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) on sulphate, an alternative method is proposed in this paper. Moreover, data assimilation is performed to adjust the chemical reaction rates of sulphate. Based on the original reactions, a new sulphate parameterisation scheme, which includes two hypothetical reactions and six undetermined parameters, was added. Based on the WRF-Chem/DART (Data Assistance Research Testbed) system, the near-ground concentrations of SO42−, SO2, NO2, O3 and particulate matter are assimilated to adjust the six parameters. After adjusting the parameters, the new scheme can effectively solve the underestimation of SO42− and overestimation of SO2. The simulation of SO42− improved as the mean bias changed from −13.1 µg m−3 to 3.5 µg m−3 while SO2 improved from 17.0 µg m−3 to 6.3 µg m−3. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics predicted by the new scheme are consistent with the theoretical research results, indicating that the complex mechanism of sulphate formation could be replaced by the temporal and spatial variation characteristics predicted by the new scheme and that the parameters can be adjusted by data assimilation. Furthermore, the reaction rates of the SO42− parameterisation scheme of the WRF-Chem model are improved in this study, and a new method for improving the accuracy of the air quality model is provided.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs) can produce multiple hazards (e.g., straight-line winds, flash flooding, and mesovortex tornadoes) that pose a significant threat to life and property, and are often difficult to accurately forecast. The NSSL Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) is a convection-allowing ensemble system developed to provide short-term, probabilistic forecasting guidance for severe convective events. Examination of WoFS’s capability to predict QLCSs has yet to be systematically assessed across a large number of cases for 0–6-h forecast times. In this study, the quality of WoFS QLCS forecasts for 50 QLCS days occurring between 2017 and 2020 is evaluated using object-based verification techniques. First, a storm mode identification and classification algorithm is tuned to identify high-reflectivity, linear convective structures. The algorithm is used to identify convective line objects in WoFS forecasts and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor system (MRMS) gridded observations. WoFS QLCS objects are matched with MRMS observed objects to generate bulk verification statistics. Results suggest WoFS’s QLCS forecasts are skillful with the 3- and 6-h forecasts having similar probability of detection and false alarm ratio values near 0.59 and 0.34, respectively. The WoFS objects are larger, more intense, and less eccentric than those in MRMS. A novel centerline analysis is performed to evaluate orientation, length, and tortuosity (i.e., curvature) differences, and spatial displacements between observed and predicted convective lines. While no systematic propagation biases are found, WoFS typically has centerlines that are more tortuous and displaced to the northwest of MRMS centerlines, suggesting WoFS may be overforecasting the intensity of the QLCS’s rear-inflow jet and northern bookend vortex. Significance Statement Quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs), also known as squall lines, can be very destructive to life and property as they produce multiple hazards such as hail, severe straight-line winds, flash flooding, and tornadoes that typically form quickly and may be difficult to observe on radar. These storms can occur year-round and have the propensity to develop overnight or into the early morning hours, potentially catching the public off-guard. An ensemble prediction system called the Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS), created by the National Severe Storms Laboratory, has shown promise in accurately forecasting a variety of severe weather events. This research evaluates the quality of the WoFS’s QLCS forecasts. Results show WoFS can accurately predict these systems for forecast times out to 6 h.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite provides visible radiances that contain critical information on clouds and precipitation. In this study, the impact of assimilating FY-4A/AGRI all-sky visible radiances on the simulation of a convective system was evaluated with an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) using a localized particle filter (PF). The localized PF was implemented into the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The results of a 2-day data assimilation (DA) experiment generated encouraging outcome at a synoptic scale. Assimilating FY-4A/AGRI visible radiances with the localized PF significantly improved the analysis and forecast of cloud water path (CWP), cloud coverage, rain rate, and rainfall areas. In addition, some positive impacts were produced on the temperature and water vapor mixing ratio in the vicinity of cloudy regions. Sensitivity studies indicated that the best results were achieved by the localized PF configured with a localization distance that is equivalent to the model grid spacing (20 km) and with an adequately short cycling interval (30 min). However, the localized PF could not improve cloud vertical structures and cloud phases due to a lack of related information in the visible radiances. Moreover, the localized PF was compared with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and it was indicated that the localized PF outperformed EAKF even when the number of ensemble members was doubled for the latter, indicating a great potential of the localized PF in assimilating visible radiances.",

The primary motivation is to gauge the impact on analysis quality attributable to the consideration of non-Gaussian forecast error distributions. Using the NASA Catchment land surface model, the two filters are compared at 18 globally distributed single-catchment locations for a 10-yr experiment period. It is shown that both filters yield adequate estimates of soil moisture, with the RHF having a small but significant performance advantage. Most notably, the RHF consistently increases the normalized information contribution (NIC) score of the mean absolute bias by 0.05 over that of the EnKF for surface, root-zone, and profile soil moisture. The RHF also increases the NIC score for the anomaly correlation of surface soil moisture by 0.02 over that of the EnKF (at a 5% significance level). Results additionally demonstrate that the performance of both filters is somewhat improved when the ensemble priors are adaptively inflated to offset the negative effects of systematic errors.",

The relaxation (so called nudging) and the ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) with various assimilation time frequencies (3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour assimilation windows) were used as assimilation methods. It was shown that the assimilation of SST data via the EnOI made it possible to reproduce hydrophysical fields more accurately than via nudging or without assimilation at all. Even with the assimilation of SST data irregularly distributed over space and time, a decrease in the calculation error was observed over the entire sea area, and the structures of the zones of temperature rise or drop were more correctly simulated. The best results were achieved with via the EnOI assimilation with an increasing assimilation frequency over time. When SST data were assimilated using the EnOI, the mean error decreased from 0.16°C (24-hour assimilation window) to 0.08°C (3-hour assimilation window); accordingly, the absolute mean error decreased from 1.03 to 0.33°C, and the standard deviation decreased from 1.33 to 0.42°C. In addition, assimilation using the EnOI 3-hour window improved the reproduction of SST during the period of convection cooling. The assimilation of SST data also led to changes in the structure of the surface sea circulation. In some areas, the direction of currents varied within 5°–10°, and the velocity modulus changed by 3–5%. The assimilation of SST data only slightly reduced errors in the structure of the model vertical temperature profile, which can reach 2°C at depths of 30–40 m. At depths greater than 100 m, deviations did not exceed 0.05°C.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The Red Sea, home to the second-longest coral reef system in the world, is a vital resource for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Red Sea provides 90% of the Kingdom’s potable water by desalinization, supporting tourism, shipping, aquaculture, and fishing industries, which together contribute about 10%–20% of the country’s GDP. All these activities, and those elsewhere in the Red Sea region, critically depend on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. At a time of mega-development projects along the Red Sea coast, and global warming, authorities are working on optimizing the harnessing of environmental resources, including renewable energy and rainwater harvesting. All these require high-resolution weather and climate information. Toward this end, we have undertaken a multipronged research and development activity in which we are developing an integrated data-driven regional coupled modeling system. The telescopically nested components include 5-km- to 600-m-resolution atmospheric models to address weather and climate challenges, 4-km- to 50-m-resolution ocean models with regional and coastal configurations to simulate and predict the general and mesoscale circulation, 4-km- to 100-m-resolution ecosystem models to simulate the biogeochemistry, and 1-km- to 50-m-resolution wave models. In addition, a complementary probabilistic transport modeling system predicts dispersion of contaminant plumes, oil spill, and marine ecosystem connectivity. Advanced ensemble data assimilation capabilities have also been implemented for accurate forecasting. Resulting achievements include significant advancement in our understanding of the regional circulation and its connection to the global climate, development, and validation of long-term Red Sea regional atmospheric–oceanic–wave reanalyses and forecasting capacities. These products are being extensively used by academia, government, and industry in various weather and marine studies and operations, environmental policies, renewable energy applications, impact assessment, flood forecasting, and more.",

		"abstract": "Iterative ensemble filters and smoothers are now commonly used for geophysical models. Some of these methods rely on a factorization of the observation likelihood function to sample from a posterior density through a set of “tempered” transitions to ensemble members. For Gaussian-based data assimilation methods, tangent linear versions of nonlinear operators can be relinearized between iterations, thus leading to a solution that is less biased than a single-step approach. This study adopts similar iterative strategies for a localized particle filter (PF) that relies on the estimation of moments to adjust unobserved variables based on importance weights. This approach builds off a “regularization” of the local PF, which forces weights to be more uniform through heuristic means. The regularization then leads to an adaptive tempering, which can also be combined with filter updates from parametric methods, such as ensemble Kalman filters. The role of iterations is analyzed by deriving the localized posterior probability density assumed by current local PF formulations and then examining how single-step and tempered PFs sample from this density. From experiments performed with a low-dimensional nonlinear system, the iterative and hybrid strategies show the largest benefits in observation-sparse regimes, where only a few particles contain high likelihoods and prior errors are non-Gaussian. This regime mimics specific applications in numerical weather prediction, where small ensemble sizes, unresolved model error, and highly nonlinear dynamics lead to prior uncertainty that is larger than measurement uncertainty.",

		"abstract": "Global estimation of thermospheric neutral density (TND) on various altitudes is important for geodetic and space weather applications. This is typically provided by models, however, the quality of these models is limited due to their imperfect structure and the sensitivity of their parameters to the calibration period. Here, we present an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based calibration and data assimilation (C/DA) technique that updates the model’s states and simultaneously calibrates its key parameters. Its application is demonstrated using the TND estimates from on-board accelerometer measurements, e.g., those of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission (at $$\\sim 410$$km altitude), as observation, and the frequently used empirical model NRLMSISE-00. The C/DA is applied here to re-calibrate the model parameters including those controlling the influence of solar radiation and geomagnetic activity as well as those related to the calculation of exospheric temperature. The resulting model, called here ‘C/DA-NRLMSISE-00’, is then used to now-cast TNDs and individual neutral mass compositions for 3 h, where the model with calibrated parameters is run again during the assimilation period. C/DA-NRLMSISE-00 is also used to forecast the next 21 h, where no new observations are introduced. These forecasts are unique because they are available globally and on various altitudes (300–600 km). To introduce the impact of the thermosphere on estimating ionospheric parameters, the coupled physics-based model TIE-GCM is run by replacing the O2, O1, He and neutral temperature estimates of the C/DA-NRLMSISE-00. Then, the non-assimilated outputs of electron density (Ne) and total electron content (TEC) are validated against independent measurements. Assessing the forecasts of TNDs with those along the Swarm-A ($$\\sim 467$$km), -B ($$\\sim 521$$km), and -C ($$\\sim 467$$km) orbits shows that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is considerably reduced by 51, 57 and 54%, respectively. We find improvement of 30.92% for forecasting Ne and 26.48% for TEC compared to the radio occulation and global ionosphere maps (GIM), respectively. The presented C/DA approach is recommended for the short-term global multi-level thermosphere and enhanced ionosphere forecasting applications.",

The benefit of UAS observations was assessed for a terrain-driven (drainage and upvalley) flow event that occurred within Colorado’s San Luis Valley (SLV) using independent observations. The analysis and prediction of the strength, depth, and horizontal extent of drainage flow from the Saguache Canyon and the subsequent transition to upvalley and up-canyon flow were improved relative to that obtained both without data assimilation (benchmark) and when only surface observations were assimilated. Assimilation of UAS observations greatly improved the analyses of vertical variations in temperature, relative humidity, and winds at multiple locations in the northern portion of the SLV, with reductions in both bias and the root-mean-square error of roughly 40% for each variable relative to the benchmark run. Despite these noted improvements, some biases remain that were tied to measurement error and/or the impact of the boundary layer parameterization on vertically spreading the observations, both of which require further exploration. The results presented here highlight how observations obtained with a fleet of profiling UAS improve limited-area, high-resolution analyses and short-term forecasts in complex terrain.",

		"abstract": "Abstract State-of-the-art ensemble prediction systems usually provide ensembles with only 20–250 members for estimating the uncertainty of the forecast and its spatial and spatiotemporal covariance. Given that the degrees of freedom of atmospheric models are several magnitudes higher, the estimates are therefore substantially affected by sampling errors. For error covariances, spurious correlations lead to random sampling errors, but also a systematic overestimation of the correlation. A common approach to mitigate the impact of sampling errors for data assimilation is to localize correlations. However, this is a challenging task given that physical correlations in the atmosphere can extend over long distances. Besides data assimilation, sampling errors pose an issue for the investigation of spatiotemporal correlations using ensemble sensitivity analysis. Our study evaluates a statistical approach for correcting sampling errors. The applied sampling error correction is a lookup table–based approach and therefore computationally very efficient. We show that this approach substantially improves both the estimates of spatial correlations for data assimilation as well as spatiotemporal correlations for ensemble sensitivity analysis. The evaluation is performed using the first convective-scale 1000-member ensemble simulation for central Europe. Correlations of the 1000-member ensemble forecast serve as truth to assess the performance of the sampling error correction for smaller subsets of the full ensemble. The sampling error correction strongly reduced both random and systematic errors for all evaluated variables, ensemble sizes, and lead times.",

		"abstract": "This study presents the first convective-scale 1,000-member ensemble simulation over central Europe, which provides a unique data set for various applications. A comparison with the operational regional 40-member ensemble of Deutscher Wetterdienst shows that the 1,000-member simulation exhibits realistic spread properties overall. Based on this, we discuss two potential applications. First, we quantify the sampling error of spatial covariances of smaller subsets compared with the 1,000-member simulation. Knowledge about sampling errors and their dependence on ensemble size is crucial for ensemble and hybrid data assimilation and for developing better approaches for localization in this context. Secondly, we present an approach for estimating the relative potential impact of different observable quantities using ensemble sensitivity analysis. This will provide the basis for consecutive studies developing future observation and data assimilation strategies. Sensitivity studies on the ensemble size indicate that about 200 ensemble members are required to estimate the potential impact of observable quantities with respect to precipitation forecasts.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The current GFDL seasonal prediction system achieved retrospective sea ice extent (SIE) skill without direct sea ice data assimilation. Here we develop sea ice data assimilation, shown to be a key source of skill for seasonal sea ice predictions, in GFDL’s next-generation prediction system, the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR). Satellite sea ice concentration (SIC) observations are assimilated into the GFDL Sea Ice Simulator version 2 (SIS2) using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). Sea ice physics is perturbed to form an ensemble of ice–ocean members with atmospheric forcing from the JRA-55 reanalysis. Assimilation is performed every 5 days from 1982 to 2017 and the evaluation is conducted at pan-Arctic and regional scales over the same period. To mitigate an assimilation overshoot problem and improve the analysis, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are restored to the daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2 (OISSTv2). The combination of SIC assimilation and SST restoring reduces analysis errors to the observational error level (~10%) from up to 3 times larger than this (~30%) in the free-running model. Sensitivity experiments show that the choice of assimilation localization half-width (190 km) is near optimal and that SIC analysis errors can be further reduced slightly either by reducing the observational error or by increasing the assimilation frequency from every 5 days to daily. A lagged-correlation analysis suggests substantial prediction skill improvements from SIC initialization at lead times of less than 2 months.",

		"abstract": "Detailed meteorological analyses based on observations extending through the middle atmosphere (∼ 15 to 100 km altitude) can provide key information to whole atmosphere modeling systems regarding the physical mechanisms linking day-to-day changes in ionospheric electron density to meteorological variability near the Earth's surface. However, the extent to which independent middle atmosphere analyses differ in their representation of wave-induced coupling to the ionosphere is unclear. To begin to address this issue, we present the first intercomparison among four such analyses, JAGUAR-DAS, MERRA-2, NAVGEM-HA, and WACCMX+DART, focusing on the Northern Hemisphere (NH) 2009–2010 winter, which includes a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). This intercomparison examines the altitude, latitude, and time dependences of zonal mean zonal winds and temperatures among these four analyses over the 1 December 2009 to 31 March 2010 period, as well as latitude and altitude dependences of monthly mean amplitudes of the diurnal and semidiurnal migrating solar tides, the eastward-propagating diurnal zonal wave number 3 nonmigrating tide, and traveling planetary waves associated with the quasi-5 d and quasi-2 d Rossby modes. Our results show generally good agreement among the four analyses up to the stratopause (∼ 50 km altitude). Large discrepancies begin to emerge in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere owing to (1) differences in the types of satellite data assimilated by each system and (2) differences in the details of the global atmospheric models used by each analysis system. The results of this intercomparison provide initial estimates of uncertainty in analyses commonly used to constrain middle atmospheric meteorological variability in whole atmosphere model simulations.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Several limited-area 80-member ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation systems with 15-km horizontal grid spacing were run over a computational domain spanning the conterminous United States (CONUS) for a 4-week period. One EnKF employed continuous cycling, where the prior ensemble was always the 1-h forecast initialized from the previous cycle’s analysis. In contrast, the other EnKFs used a partial cycling procedure, where limited-area states were discarded after 12 or 18 h of self-contained hourly cycles and reinitialized the next day from global model fields. “Blended” states were also constructed by combining large scales from global ensemble initial conditions (ICs) with small scales from limited-area continuously cycling EnKF analyses using a low-pass filter. Both the blended states and EnKF analysis ensembles initialized 36-h, 10-member ensemble forecasts with 3-km horizontal grid spacing. Continuously cycling EnKF analyses initialized ∼1–18-h precipitation forecasts that were comparable to or somewhat better than those with partial cycling EnKF ICs. Conversely, ∼18–36-h forecasts with partial cycling EnKF ICs were comparable to or better than those with unblended continuously cycling EnKF ICs. However, blended ICs yielded ∼18–36-h forecasts that were statistically indistinguishable from those with partial cycling ICs. ICs that more closely resembled global analysis spectral characteristics at wavelengths > 200 km, like partial cycling and blended ICs, were associated with relatively good ∼18–36-h forecasts. Ultimately, findings suggest that EnKFs employing a combination of continuous cycling and blending can potentially replace the partial cycling assimilation systems that currently initialize operational limited-area models over the CONUS without sacrificing forecast quality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerical weather prediction models (i.e., weather models) are initialized through a process called data assimilation, which combines real atmospheric observations with a previous short-term weather model forecast using statistical techniques. The overarching data assimilation strategy currently used to initialize operational regional weather models over the United States has several disadvantages that ultimately limit progress toward improving weather model forecasts. Thus, we suggest an alternative data assimilation strategy be adopted to initialize a next-generation, high-resolution (∼3 km) probabilistic forecast system currently being developed. This alternative approach preserves forecast quality while fostering a framework that can accelerate weather model improvements, which in turn will lead to better weather forecasts.",
